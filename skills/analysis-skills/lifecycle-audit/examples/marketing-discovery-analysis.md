Slack conversation notes and call transcripts.

2\. Client Stated Needs vs Observed Needs

2.1 Explicit Client Request

*Direct quote from Trevor Ruby (Slack, January 21, 2026):*

> *\"we really really want a communication tool\"*

Additional context from kickoff call: \"The efficiency of our
communications with the customers is the main pain point.\" - Trevor
Ruby

2.2 What the Client Actually Needs

The communication tool request is a symptom, not the root cause.
Evidence reveals multiple interconnected system failures:

  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------
  **Stated Need**            **Actual Underlying Problem**

  Communication tool         Cliq app adoption failure; clients refuse to
                             download

  Better client comms        ASMs lack expertise to answer strategic
                             questions; Trevor personally monitors 300
                             accounts

  Reduce churn               Sales incentives drive volume over quality;
                             74% churn rate (164 lost / 221 gained)

  Scale operations           Manual processes everywhere; 10-person
                             social team posting manually to 200+ pages
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------

**Critical Insight:** A communication tool alone will not fix the
underlying operational tax. The real need is systematic automation of
the client lifecycle combined with elevated client qualification
standards.

3\. Operational and Financial Reality

3.1 Revenue and Profitability (2025 Full Year)

  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  **Metric**                            **Amount**

  Gross Sales                           \$2,003,921

  **Net Operating Income**              **\$118,572 (6.5%)**
  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

3.2 Labor Cost Breakdown (COGS)

  ------------------------------ -------------------- --------------------
  **Department**                 **Annual Cost**      **% of COGS**

  Sales (Commissions + Support + \$499,756            45.0%
  Training)                                           

  Web Development                \$198,730            17.9%

  SEO Contract Labor             \$159,445            14.4%

  Social Media Contract Labor    \$147,731            13.3%

-   **Taxes & Licenses:** \$42,394

-   **Ask My Accountant (Uncategorized):** \$41,820

-   **All Other Expenses:** \$161,940

3.4 Financial Red Flags

1.  **Refund Rate of 9.4%:** \$188,593 in refunds + returned ACH
    payments signals significant client dissatisfaction or billing
    issues.

2.  **Sales Compensation at 45% of COGS:** Disproportionate commission
    structure incentivizes volume over quality.

3.  **Negative Months:** February (-\$24K), April (-\$38K), September
    (-\$61K) show operational volatility.

4.  **Software Spend Opacity:** \$146K in \'Office Supplies & Software\'
    lacks granular breakdown for optimization.

4\. Communication Breakdown Analysis

4.1 Current Communication Infrastructure

**Primary Channel:** Cliq (Zoho messaging app) - requires client
download

**Problem:** \"Clients want to text/message directly, but team members
don\'t want 300 people with their personal numbers\" - MH-1 Onboarding
Document

**Volume:** 3,550 SMS log records from March 2025 to January 2026
indicate significant messaging activity already exists outside Cliq.

4.2 Evidence from Client Communication Samples

Analysis of Cliq Chat PDFs reveals systemic communication failures:

-   **Stcyr Industries:** Client states \"I thought I had submitted a
    card. I hope I didn\'t send it to somebody else. Lol.\" Multiple
    back-and-forth messages over 2+ weeks to resolve payment method.

-   **TyCalK9:** Client confused about Google verification requirements:
    \"Why do I need to do a background check just to run google ads\...I
    was running google ads with a previous company just fine.\"

-   **Total Family Solutions:** 13+ days between website updates and
    client requests for status; multiple handoffs between Jason, Carter,
    Bethany, and Megan.

-   **Fairway Carts:** Report shows -27% phone calls vs previous period,
    -3% website clicks - no proactive communication about declining
    metrics.

4.3 Root Cause: Communication Compensates for Broken Processes

The communication pain is not a standalone problem. Evidence shows:

-   **Onboarding stalls:** Manual collection of credentials, payment
    info, and approvals creates 4-6 week delays

-   **No automated status updates:** Clients must ask \"Can we have an
    update on everything going on for this client, please?\" (Carter
    Simmons, Jan 5 2026)

-   **Role confusion:** Multiple team members respond to same client
    without coordination

-   **ASM knowledge gap:** \"ASMs are not Internet marketers\" - Trevor.
    They cannot answer strategic questions.

**Conclusion:** A new communication tool without process automation will
only centralize the chaos. The tool must be paired with onboarding
automation, status broadcasting, and AI-assisted triage to address root
causes.

5\. Lifecycle, CRO, Sales, and Support Findings

5.1 Customer Growth and Churn (2025)

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  **Metric**        **Value**         **Metric**        **Value**

  Accounts Gained   221               Accounts Lost     164

  Net Change        +57               Churn Rate        **74.2%**
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

Monthly Churn Pattern

-   **July 2025:** Net -9 (23 lost, 14 gained)

-   **November 2025:** Net 0 (22 lost, 22 gained)

-   **December 2025:** Net -17 (30 lost, 13 gained) - CRITICAL

5.2 Sales Process Analysis

**Qualification Criteria (Stated):** \$1,000+ service budget, \$500+ ad
spend, 3-month minimum, multiple employees

**Actual Behavior:** \"Possibly, quite possibly it\'s due to the
salesman\'s incentive to sell anything that moves and not sell only good
customers that would be a really great fit.\" - Trevor Ruby

**Average Customer Value:** \$750/month - below the \$1,000 stated
minimum qualification

5.3 Lifecycle Drop-off Points

5.  **Onboarding (Days 1-30):** Manual form completion, credential
    collection, app download friction

6.  **Website Build (Weeks 2-6):** 4-6 week timeline, domain/access
    delays, no automated follow-up

7.  **Month 2-3:** Client sees no results yet; limited proactive
    communication

8.  **Month 4+:** Churn decision point - clients unclear on value
    delivered

5.4 Service Delivery Efficiency

**Team Structure (from Slack notes):**

-   Social Media Team: 10 FT @ \$16-18k/month

-   Web Development: 6 FT @ \$16-18k/month

-   SEO/Google Team: 5 FT @ \$6.5-7k/month

-   AM Team: 3 ASMs

-   Sales: 2 reps + 2 support

-   Reporting: 1 PT

**Critical Insight:** \"Tom, Deuce and myself are the Internet marketers
in this company. And everybody else is like, they\'re doing tasks that
they\'ve been instructed how to do these tasks.\" - Trevor. This creates
a bottleneck where Trevor must personally oversee all strategic work.

6\. Module Opportunities and Prioritization

6.1 Recommended Modules (Priority Order)

Module 1: Unified Communications Hub

-   **Pain Point:** Cliq adoption failure; clients refuse app downloads;
    team phones exposed

-   **Evidence:** 3,550 SMS logs show significant non-Cliq messaging;
    \"we really really want a communication tool\" - Trevor

-   **Solution:** Zoho SMS inbox as primary channel with AI triage,
    auto-responses, and routing

-   **Replaces:** Cliq app requirement, personal phone exposure, manual
    message routing

-   **Impact:** Reduce response latency, decrease churn from
    communication gaps, protect team boundaries

Module 2: Adaptive Onboarding Engine

-   **Pain Point:** \"One size fits all\" onboarding form; 4-6 week
    website timeline; manual credential collection

-   **Evidence:** Onboarding form requires all fields regardless of
    services; Total Family Solutions shows 13+ day gaps

-   **Solution:** Dynamic paths based on purchased services,
    auto-prefill from GBP/website, automated nudges

-   **Replaces:** Manual ASM walkthrough, static forms, manual follow-up

-   **Impact:** Cut onboarding time 50%, reduce ASM labor, decrease
    early churn

Module 3: Content Factory

-   **Pain Point:** 10-person social team manually posting to 200+
    pages; limited strategic bandwidth

-   **Evidence:** \$147,731 social media labor cost; \"team is keeping
    up just to post for everybody\" - call transcript

-   **Solution:** AI content generation with vertical templates,
    approve/revise queue, auto-scheduling

-   **Replaces:** Manual content creation, copy-paste workflows,
    per-client creative labor

-   **Impact:** Reduce social team by 50-75%, reallocate to strategic
    work

Module 4: Performance Monitoring Dashboard

-   **Pain Point:** Trevor manually monitors 300 accounts; no automated
    alerts

-   **Evidence:** \"I\'m always checking it\" - Trevor; Fairway Carts
    shows declining metrics with no proactive outreach

-   **Solution:** API integration with Facebook/Google, threshold-based
    alerts, auto-generated reports

-   **Replaces:** Manual account checking, reactive client updates

-   **Impact:** Free 10+ hours/week of Trevor\'s time, enable proactive
    client communication

Module 5: Lead Qualification & Packaging Engine

-   **Pain Point:** Sales incentives drive volume over quality; 74%
    churn rate

-   **Evidence:** \$750 ACV vs \$1,000 stated minimum; \"salesman\'s
    incentive to sell anything that moves\"

-   **Solution:** Lead scoring in Zoho, minimum budget enforcement,
    package recommendations

-   **Replaces:** Manual qualification judgment, flexible pricing that
    erodes margin

-   **Impact:** Increase starting fees, reduce early churn, protect
    margin

6.2 Modules to Avoid

-   **Full CRM Replacement:** Zoho is entrenched; migration risk
    outweighs benefit. Build on existing infrastructure.

-   **Custom Client Portal:** If clients won\'t download Cliq, they
    won\'t use a portal. SMS/text is the right channel.

-   **AI Sales Closer:** Sales is relationship-driven; \"people love
    Trevor\" - Deuce. Augment, don\'t replace.

7\. What the Team Likely Missed

7.1 The Communication Tool is a Red Herring

Trevor\'s explicit request for a communication tool is symptomatic, not
diagnostic. The evidence shows communication failures are downstream of
onboarding delays, role confusion, and expertise gaps. A new tool
without process changes will centralize noise, not resolve it.

7.2 Trevor is the Single Point of Failure

Every operational thread leads back to Trevor: monitoring ads, checking
quality, approving strategy, managing high-value clients. The business
cannot scale because Trevor cannot be cloned. The priority must be
removing Trevor from recurring operational loops through automation and
guardrails.

7.3 Sales Compensation is Misaligned

45% of COGS goes to sales compensation, yet churn is 74%. The incentive
structure rewards volume, not retention. Until sales comp includes a
clawback or 90-day retention bonus, the team will continue acquiring
low-quality clients.

7.4 The Social Media Team is Doing Machine Work

10 FTEs manually posting to 200+ Facebook pages is a failure of
automation adoption. This is the clearest ROI opportunity: AI content
generation could reduce this team by 50-75% while improving consistency.

7.5 Refunds Signal Deeper Problems

\$188,593 in refunds and returned payments (9.4% of gross) is abnormally
high. This suggests either (a) billing issues from incorrect payment
collection, (b) client dissatisfaction leading to chargebacks, or (c)
both. The onboarding form shows payment collection is manual and
error-prone.

7.6 December Churn is a Crisis Signal

Net -17 accounts in December 2025 (30 lost, 13 gained) represents 18.3%
of annual churn in a single month. This coincides with year-end budget
reviews by clients. The agency likely lacks renewal touchpoints and
value demonstration at renewal decision points.

8\. Risks, Open Questions, and Discovery Gaps

8.1 Data Gaps

-   **Org Chart:** File was binary-encoded; team structure reconstructed
    from notes

-   **Cancellation Reasons:** No structured data on why clients churn

-   **Client Tier Segmentation:** Account Status field inconsistently
    populated

-   **Service-Level Revenue:** Cannot map revenue to individual services
    (SEO vs Social vs Web)

-   **Software Cost Breakdown:** \$146K \'Office Supplies & Software\'
    is opaque

8.2 Open Questions for Client

9.  What is the current monthly ad spend on client acquisition (Facebook
    lead gen)?

10. What is the cost per acquired client and target payback period?

11. Which clients are on legacy pricing vs standard pricing?

12. What percentage of clients are in each service tier (SEO only,
    bundle, premium)?

13. Is there a formal churn exit interview process?

14. What tools comprise the \$146K software spend?

8.3 Implementation Risks

-   **Team Resistance:** ASMs may resist automation that changes their
    role

-   **Zoho Limitations:** Unknown ceiling on customization and API
    integrations

-   **Content Quality:** AI-generated content must meet Trevor\'s
    standards; requires guardrails

-   **Sales Compensation Change:** Restructuring commissions will face
    pushback from sales team

8.4 Confidence Levels

  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------
  **Finding**                               **Confidence**

  Financial totals and P&L structure        **HIGH**

  Churn figures (221 gained, 164 lost)      **HIGH**

  Communication tool as symptom, not root   **HIGH**
  cause                                     

  Team headcount estimates                  **MEDIUM**

  Content automation ROI projection         **MEDIUM**

  Service-level profitability               **LOW (data gap)**
  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------

Executive Summary

Found It Marketing is a \$2M revenue digital marketing agency with a 74%
churn problem disguised as a communication problem. The client has
explicitly requested a communication tool, but the evidence reveals
systemic failures across onboarding, sales qualification, service
delivery automation, and owner dependency.

**Immediate Priority:** Deploy a Unified Communications Hub (SMS-based)
to address the stated need while simultaneously building the Adaptive
Onboarding Engine to fix the root cause.

**Highest ROI Opportunity:** Content Factory automation to reduce
10-person social media team labor by 50-75%.

**Highest Risk Area:** Sales compensation misalignment. Without
restructuring incentives, new clients will continue to churn at
unsustainable rates.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Begin with Module 1 (Comms Hub) as a quick
win to demonstrate value, but sequence Module 2 (Onboarding) immediately
after. Module 5 (Lead Qualification) is politically sensitive but
financially critical.
