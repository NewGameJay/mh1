PART 5: FINAL CHECK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

□ Does the email acknowledge their current state?
□ Does it address their #1 objection preemptively?
□ Does it offer a personal win (not just business ROI)?
□ Is the switching cost/commitment clear?
□ Would I reply to this if I were them?

If any box is unchecked → revise before sending.

Campaign: Outbound Automation Tool
Target Role: VP of Sales
Date: 2024-01-15

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Current State:
├─ How they do this now: SDRs manually research on LinkedIn,
│  Sales Nav for data, generic templates with light personalization
├─ What's broken/annoying: Slow (10-15 min per prospect),
│  inconsistent quality, new hires take 2-3 months to ramp
└─ What breaks when they scale: Can't 3x volume without 3x
   headcount, training becomes bottleneck

What They're Responsible For:
├─ Primary KPI #1: Pipeline generation
├─ Primary KPI #2: SDR/BDR productivity
└─ Primary KPI #3: Cost per qualified lead

Success Looks Like:
├─ What gets them promoted: Hitting pipeline without budget increase
├─ What gets them praised: SDRs exceeding quotas
└─ What makes them look smart: Board meeting with "ahead of plan"

Failure Looks Like:
├─ What gets them in trouble: Missing pipeline targets
├─ What keeps them up at night: SDR team burning out or churning
└─ What makes them look bad: "Why aren't we seeing more meetings?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 2: MAP THE WINS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Business Win (What the company gets):
3x outbound volume with same team size, faster new hire ramp,
consistent quality across all reps

Personal Win (What THEY get individually):
Look like a hero ("tripled pipeline without adding headcount"),
less stress managing underperforming SDRs, easier board meetings

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 3: ANTICIPATE OBJECTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Switching Costs:
├─ Time investment required: 2-4 weeks to onboard and train
├─ Political risk: If it doesn't work, we fall behind
└─ Learning curve: Need to convince CFO on ROI

Top 3 Objections:

1. Objection: "We already have Sales Nav and Outreach"
   How to preempt: "Have you figured out how to do personalized
   research at scale without adding headcount?"

2. Objection: "My SDRs are already busy"
   How to preempt: "Most teams we work with save 10 min per
   prospect on research"

3. Objection: "We tried automation before and it felt robotic"
   How to preempt: Show example with AI-generated personalization
   that doesn't feel templated

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 4: EMAIL STRATEGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

First line should acknowledge:
Their current manual process / hiring SDRs / using Sales Nav

Value prop should address:
Save time (10 min per prospect) AND scale (3x volume)

CTA should offer:
Low-effort first step: "Worth a look?" not "30 min call"
