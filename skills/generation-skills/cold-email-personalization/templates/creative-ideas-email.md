Creative Ideas Campaign - Show 3 specific ideas for their company
</template_type>

<when_to_use>
Use when you can generate specific, credible ideas that demonstrate your capabilities. Best for services that are visual/tangible (marketing, content, dev). Often used as Email 2 in a sequence.
</when_to_use>

**FEATURE-CONSTRAIN YOUR IDEAS**

Before generating ideas, define your constraint box (3-5 features you ACTUALLY offer). Each idea must use ONE feature from this box.

Never hallucinate capabilities you don't have.
</critical_rule>

<structure>
```
Subject: [2-4 words: "Marketing ideas", "Quick ideas"]

{{First_name}} – I was back on your site today and had some [type] ideas for you.

{{Creative Ideas}}
• Idea 1: [Action using Feature X]—would help with [benefit]
• Idea 2: [Action using Feature Y]—could improve [goal]
• Idea 3: [Action using Feature Z]—might address [challenge]

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry.
```
</structure>

<template_a>
**Marketing Agency → SaaS Company**

Constraint box: Paid social, SEO content, Email nurture

```
Subject: Marketing ideas

{{First_name}} – I was back on your site today and had some marketing ideas for you.

• Paid social campaign targeting {{target_audience}} using LinkedIn's "job function" targeting—would help reach decision-makers directly instead of relying on organic only

• SEO content series around "{{keyword_cluster}}" and "{{competitor}} vs {{product}}" based on keyword gaps—could capture high-intent searches

• Email nurture sequence for trial users who haven't converted, addressing objections from your G2 reviews—would improve trial-to-paid conversion

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry.

<template_b>
**Content Shop → E-commerce Brand**

Constraint box: Product videos, UGC creation, Email copy

```
Subject: Creative ideas

{{First_name}},

I was on your site and had a few creative ideas for {{company_name}}:

• Product videos showing your {{product_category}} in different settings (office, weekend, travel)—we helped similar brands increase add-to-cart rates by 23% when buyers could see products in context

• UGC campaign collecting customer photos/videos—creates social proof and gives you content for Instagram/email without in-house production

• Email sequences segmented by style preference based on browsing behavior—would make campaigns feel personalized instead of one-size-fits-all

These are just initial thoughts without knowing your priorities.

Would it make sense to chat about what could move the needle for {{company_name}}?
```
</template_b>

<template_c>
**Dev Shop → B2B SaaS**

Constraint box: Product videos, Interactive calculators, API integrations

```
Subject: Starter vs. Professional plan

{{First_name}} – had a question about Starter vs. Pro.

Starter is for platform access, Pro is for API integrations.

Do you have a product video showing how easy those integrations are and how much more {{target_role}} would get if they upgraded?

Some other ideas that could help with upgrades:
• Interactive ROI calculator on pricing page showing time saved with Pro features—helps justify cost to decision-makers
• Custom onboarding flow for Pro trials highlighting integration benefits in first 3 days—reduces "I don't see the value" churn

We've attributed 4.7x increase in upgrades after adding product videos.

Worth a chat?
```
</template_c>

<idea_formula>
**For each idea, use this formula:**

```
[Action verb] + [Feature from constraint box] + [Specific to their company] + [Why it would help]
```

**Examples:**
- "Paid social campaign targeting [audience] using [platform feature]—would help [benefit]"
- "SEO content series around [keyword cluster] based on competitor gaps—could capture [outcome]"
- "Product videos showing [their product] in [context]—we helped similar brands [metric]"
</idea_formula>

<quality_checklist>
Before including any idea:

- [ ] Uses ONE feature from your constraint box?
- [ ] Specific to THEIR company (not generic)?
- [ ] Explains the benefit ("would help with...")?
- [ ] Credible—could you actually deliver this?
- [ ] No more than 3 ideas total?
</quality_checklist>

<variants>
**Variant: Ideas + Case Study**
Add metric after ideas:
```
We've helped other {{industry}} companies with similar approaches—one saw {{case_study_metric}} in {{timeframe}}.
```

**Variant: Ideas + Resource Offer**
End with:
```
If you're not ready to chat, I have some resources on {{topic}} that might be useful. Want me to send those over?
```

**Variant: Ideas + Competitive Insight**
Start with:
```
I noticed {{competitor}} is doing {{thing}} well. Here are some ways you could differentiate...
```
