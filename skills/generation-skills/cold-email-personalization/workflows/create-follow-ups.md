<objective>
Create Email 2, 3, and 4 for a cold email sequence. Each email should use a different value prop angle since the previous angle didn't resonate.
</objective>

<philosophy>
**Email 1:** They haven't seen it yet → Full campaign
**Email 2:** They saw it but didn't reply → Try different value prop
**Email 3:** Still no reply → New thread, different angle, maybe drop AI
**Email 4:** Final email → Redirect OR offer resources

**Key insight:** If they didn't reply to Email 1, that angle didn't resonate. Don't repeat it—rotate through different value propositions.
</philosophy>

<three_offers_framework>
There are only 3 offers in the world:
1. **Save time** (efficiency, automation)
2. **Save money** (reduce costs, better ROI)
3. **Make money** (increase revenue, conversions)

**Rotation:**
- Email 1 used: [identify which]
- Email 2: Rotate to a different one
- Email 3: Try the third, or go back to #1 with new evidence
</three_offers_framework>

<process>
<step_1>
**Identify Email 1 Angle**

What value prop did Email 1 lead with?
- Save time?
- Save money?
- Make money?

Email 2 should use a DIFFERENT angle.
</step_1>

<step_2>
**Draft Email 2 (Day 3-4)**

**Subject:** NONE (threads to Email 1 in SmartLead/Instantly)

**Strategy options:**
1. **Creative Ideas** - Show 3 specific ideas for them
2. **Stats/Data Hook** - Show interesting data about their company
3. **Industry Insights** - Offer expertise on trends

**Template - Creative Ideas:**
```
{{First name}} – I was back on your site today and had some marketing ideas for you.

{{Creative Ideas}}
• Idea 1: [Specific action using Feature X]
• Idea 2: [Specific action using Feature Y]
• Idea 3: [Specific action using Feature Z]

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry.
```

**Template - Stats/Data:**
```
{{First name}} – I sent an email with the subject "{{Email 1 subject}}" that probably didn't do a good enough job showing you how we could help.

For example at {{company}}:
• Your sales team has seen a {{percent_change}}% change in the past 3 months
• Your LinkedIn company account has gained {{followers}} in the past 3 months
• The company has {{salespeople_count}} with "Sales" in their title

Wanna make it happen?
```
</step_2>

<step_3>
**Draft Email 3 (Day 7-8)**

**Subject:** NEW subject line (fresh thread)

**Strategy:** Consider dropping ALL AI personalization

**Why drop AI:** By Email 3, they've seen your name twice. If personalization didn't work, try direct + punchy.

**Template - Expertise (Drop AI):**
```
Subject: Paid Ads Strategy

{{First name}} – I was just taking a look at your LinkedIn profile and noticed you've held multiple marketing roles before joining {{company}}.

In that time, I'm sure you've gained wide experience in various areas of marketing. Here at [Agency], we've helped hundreds of customers with their paid media strategies and that's all we do.

We're seeing lots of changes in the paid media environment and I wondered if it made sense to hop on a call to discuss these insights.
```

**Template - Whole Offer (Reset):**
```
Subject: Scaling outbound without headcount

{{First name}},

Most teams hit a wall when they need to 3x outbound volume but can't justify 3x headcount.

We've built automation that combines 40+ databases so your reps spend zero time on manual research.

Helped companies like yours go from 100 → 500 emails/day per rep with the same team size.

Worth exploring?
```

**Template - Case Study:**
```
Subject: [Customer type] case study

{{First name}},

Quick story: [Customer type] was struggling with [problem].

They were [bad state] and needed to [outcome].

We helped them [action] and they saw [metric] in [timeframe].

Given what {{company}} does, figured this might be relevant.

Worth a quick chat?
```
</step_3>

<step_4>
**Draft Email 4 (Day 11-12)**

**Subject:** Can thread OR new (your choice)

**Strategy:** Choose one:

**Path A - Redirect to Another Person:**
```
{{First name}} – Let me know if I should reach out to {{employee_1_name}} ({{title_1}}) or {{employee_2_name}} ({{title_2}}) instead about {{specific_problem}}.

Either way, appreciate the time!
```

**Path B - Offer Resources:**
```
{{First name}} – Alternatively, if working with {{company}} is taking all of your time, we have some resources on [topic] that could help [specific benefit].

Would it be useful if I sent those over?
```

**Path C - Value Bomb (Show Capability):**
```
Subject: show and tell

{{First name}} – Last email. I figured you sell to customers like {{customer_type_1}}, {{customer_type_2}}, {{customer_type_3}}.

I went ahead and pulled them off LinkedIn for you using our system. No human wrote this email.

{{Contact_1}} – {{LinkedIn}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact_2}} – {{LinkedIn}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact_3}} – {{LinkedIn}} – {{Email}}

</output_format>

<when_to_stop>
After Email 4, if still no reply:

- DO move to next prospect

**Your goal is replies, not persistence awards.**
</when_to_stop>

<success_criteria>
- Each email uses different value prop angle
- Email 2 threads (no subject)
- Email 3 starts fresh thread (new subject)
- Email 4 provides graceful exit OR value bomb
- All emails pass QA checklist
</success_criteria>
