10 real campaign examples with annotations explaining what made them work and why they convert.
</overview>

<example_1>
**Pricing Page Insight Campaign (Product Video Company)**

Context: Targeting SaaS founders. Using Claygent + ZenRows to scrape pricing pages.

**Why It Works:**
- Uses pricing page data (Claygent finds it, ZenRows scrapes it)
- AI generates content from LinkedIn description + pricing page
- Ties video to specific revenue outcome (plan upgrades)
- Stands out from generic agency pitches

**PUNCHY VERSION (64 words):**
```
Subject: Starter vs. Professional

{{First_name}}—had a question about Starter vs. Pro.

Seemed like Starter is for platform access, Pro is for API integrations with CRM.

Do you have a product video showing how easy those integrations are and how much more sales leaders get if they upgrade?

We've attributed 4.7x increase in upgrades after adding product videos.

Worth a chat?
```

**Annotations:**
- Opens with specific research (pricing tiers)
- Questions their current state (do you have...)
- Metric proof (4.7x)
- Low-effort CTA
</example_1>

<example_2>
**Vanta Engagement Alerts (Simple But Effective)**

Context: Targeting sales/marketing people who could benefit from knowing who engages with competitor content.

**Why It Works:**
- Opens with relevant question
- Explains product in one clear sentence
- Low-effort CTA (just confirm an example)
- No AI needed—just simple, direct

**PUNCHY VERSION (48 words):**
```
Subject: Quick question

{{First_name}}—do you get alerts when prospects engage with Vanta's posts?

We pull everyone engaging with any LinkedIn company page, filter by your ICP titles, and send alerts.

Just confirm Vanta works as an example and I'll send you their last 10 posts' engagers.
```

**Annotations:**
- 48 words—ultra tight
- Specific capability described
- CTA is just "confirm example"
- Offers immediate value (send engagers)
</example_2>

<example_3>
**LinkedIn Posting Consistency (Taplio)**

Context: Saw someone posted about a topic, then noticed gap in posting frequency.

**Why It Works:**
- Specific observation (posted X days ago)
- Infers intent (building brand on LinkedIn)
- Follower count adds credibility
- Mentions specific tool capability

```
Subject: saw your post

{{first_name}} – Saw one of your recent LinkedIn posts about {{ai_generation}}.

Seems like the last time you posted was {{number_of_days}} days before that though.

With {{number_of_followers}} followers I figured building your brand on LinkedIn might be a priority for you.

LinkedIn's own guidelines stress the importance of consistently creating content. Creators are using our platform to brainstorm, evaluate top performing posts in their niche, and schedule all from one place.

Could I show you how it works sometime?
```

**Annotations:**
- AI-generated post topic
- Days between posts (shows you looked)
- Follower count proves they have audience
- "LinkedIn's own guidelines" = situational social proof
</example_3>

<example_4>
**Google Review Reputation Management**

Context: Local business with negative review. Offering removal help.

**Why It Works:**
- Opens with specific review (Karen, Roger, showing up late)
- Risk reversal ("only pay when successful")
- Value-exchange CTA (need backstory for Google)

```
Subject: Review from Karen

Howdy {{first_name}} - is that review Karen left about Roger showing up late accurate or should people ignore it?

The reason I ask is because we help companies remove untrue/unfair Google reviews and you only pay when it's successfully taken down.

Could you tell me over a call more about the back story so we can make a case to Google on your behalf?
```

**Annotations:**
- Serper + Clay: Found Google CID, scraped reviews
- Specific names (Karen, Roger) prove it's not templated
- Risk reversal addresses objection
- CTA explains why they should meet (plead case to Google)
</example_4>

<example_5>
**Property Management (Whole Offer Strategy)**

Context: Reaching out to property managers about late rent payments.

**Why It Works:**
- Subject + preview = entire offer
- Self-selecting (either they have this problem or don't)
- Uses their language ("NOI")
- Light AI touch (nearest mall)

**PUNCHY VERSION (52 words):**
```
Subject: Ever chase renters for rent?

{{First_name}},

We reward renters for paying on time so you increase NOI.

Renters who pay on time get Starbucks gift cards they can spend at {{nearest_mall}}.

If we could increase on-time payments, would that be useful?
```

**Annotations:**
- Whole offer in subject
- 52 words—no fluff
- Binary CTA (useful or not?)
- Light personalization (nearest mall)
</example_5>

<example_6>
**Competitor Insights (Marketing Agency)**

Context: New marketing leader, using SimilarWeb competitive data.

**Why It Works:**
- AI-generated tenure/title from LinkedIn
- SimilarWeb data proves research
- Name-drops clients contextually
- Positioned as process ("first thing we do")

```
Subject: competitor insights

{{First Name}} – I noticed on LI that you recently started leading marketing at {{Company Name}}.

I did some further digging on SimilarWeb and saw that companies like {{competitor}} are taking some of the same digital real estate keywords and space your company ranks for.

One of the very first things we do when working with companies like Airbnb, HotJar, and Justworks is get an understanding of the competitive landscape.

We help companies execute custom marketing plans when they don't have the team bandwidth or expertise to do so.

Would this be worth a chat for {{Company Name}}?
```

**Annotations:**
- LinkedIn + SimilarWeb research
- Competitor data is specific
- Case study names as process, not braggy
- "bandwidth" angle = personal benefit
</example_6>

<example_7>
**Creative Ideas Campaign (Follow-Up)**

Context: Email 2 in sequence, generating custom ideas.

**Why It Works:**
- Bullet point ideas (visual, easy to scan)
- Honest disclaimer ("wrote without knowing")
- Offers industry insights on call
- Feature-constrained ideas

```
Threaded to Email 1 (3 days later)

{{First Name}} – I was back on your site today and had some marketing ideas for you.

{{Creative Ideas}}
• Paid social campaign targeting [specific audience] using [specific platform feature]
• SEO content series around [keyword cluster] based on competitor gaps
• Email nurture sequence for [customer segment] that addresses [specific pain]

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry. Especially in the {{harmonic_keywords}} niche.
```

**Annotations:**
- Ideas must be feature-constrained
- Disclaimer invites conversation
- Industry-specific = AI-generated
- "Share what's working" = value-exchange
</example_7>

<example_8>
**Final Email Value Bomb (Email 4)**

Context: Email 4, offering immediate value by pulling contacts.

**Why It Works:**
- "Last email" sets expectation
- Gives immediate value (actual contacts)
- Shows capability ("No human wrote this")
- Low-friction CTA (watch video)

```
Subject: show and tell

{{First Name}} – Last email. I figured you sell to customers like {{customer_type_1}}, {{customer_type_2}}, {{customer_type_3}}.

I went ahead and pulled them off of LinkedIn for you using our system. No human wrote this email.

{{Contact}} – {{LinkedIn Link}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact}} – {{LinkedIn Link}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact}} – {{LinkedIn Link}} – {{Email}}

Want to see a video of how I did this automatically?
```

**Annotations:**
- Customer types AI-generated from website
- Actual contacts pulled via Clay + LinkedIn
- Proof of capability (showing, not telling)
- CTA is just "see video"
</example_8>

<example_9>
**Paid Ads Strategy (Email 3 - Dropping AI)**

Context: Email 3, no AI personalization, straightforward pitch.

**Why It Works:**
- Acknowledges their experience (ego stroke)
- Specialist positioning ("that's all we do")
- Mentions environment changes (urgency)
- Optional pixel tracking insight

```
Subject: Paid Ads Strategy

{{First Name}} – I was just taking a look at your LinkedIn profile and noticed you have held multiple marketing roles before joining {{Company}}.

In that time, I'm sure you've gained a wide experience in various areas of marketing. Here at [Agency], we have helped hundreds of customers with their paid media strategies and that's all we do.

{{Company pixel/tracking insight if available}}

We are seeing lots of changes in the paid media environment and I wondered if it made sense to hop on a call to discuss these insights.
```

**Annotations:**
- Minimal AI (just tenure/role)
- "That's all we do" = deep expertise
- Environment changes = FOMO/urgency
- Optional tech signal keeps it somewhat personal
</example_9>

<example_10>
**Resource Offer (Email 4 Alternative)**

Context: Email 4, offering resources instead of meeting.

**Why It Works:**
- Acknowledges they're busy
- Offers value without commitment
- Specific benefit ("decrease experimentation time")
- Ultra-low friction CTA

```
Threaded to Email 3

{{First Name}} – Alternatively, if working with {{Company}} is taking all of your time, we have some resources on the current environment that could help decrease your experimentation time and wasted money.

Would it be useful if I sent those over?
```

**Annotations:**
- Empathy ("taking all your time")
- Not just "resources" but specific benefit
- Binary CTA (yes/no)
- Graceful exit that keeps door open
</example_10>

<key_patterns>
**Across All Examples:**

1. **First line = situation recognition** with data or AI insight
2. **Case studies tied to specific metrics** (4.7x, not just "we helped")
3. **Low-effort CTAs** (confirm, yes/no, send access)
4. **Value-exchange when asking for meetings** (not just "let's chat")
5. **AI generation used strategically** (not everywhere, just where it adds specificity)
6. **Fallback to simple when data is limited** (whole offer strategy works)
</key_patterns>
