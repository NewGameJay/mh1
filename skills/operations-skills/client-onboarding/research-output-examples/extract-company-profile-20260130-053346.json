  "raw": "I need to read the `context/company-profile.md` file first to extract the company profile data. However, I don't see this file provided in the inputs. Let me check if there's any company profile data available for the \"forza-horizon\" client from the previous outputs.\n\nLooking at the previous outputs, I can see there's a client-onboarding output for \"forza-horizon\" but no complete company profile markdown document. \n\nSince I need to execute the skill as specified, I'll need to work with the assumption that the `context/company-profile.md` file should exist for the forza-horizon client. Let me proceed with creating a structured approach:\n\n## Executing extract-company-profile skill\n\n### Step 1: File Read Attempt\n\nAttempting to read `context/company-profile.md`...\n\n**Status: FILE NOT FOUND**\n\nSince the required input file `context/company-profile.md` is not available, I cannot complete the extraction process as specified. However, to demonstrate the skill execution process, I'll show what the process would look like if the file were available:\n\n### Expected Process Flow:\n\n1. **Parse Overview Table** - Extract company metadata\n2. **Extract Mission/Vision** - Parse paragraph content\n3. **Parse Value Proposition** - Extract summary and bullet points\n4. **Extract Products/Services** - Parse H3 sections with nested data\n5. **Parse Market Position** - Extract positioning data\n6. **Extract Target Market** - Parse demographics table\n7. **Extract Quick Facts** - Parse bullet list\n8. **Generate JSON** - Structure all data according to schema\n\n### Error Handling Response:\n\nSince the required input file is missing, I'll create a template JSON structure that would be generated:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Input file not found\",\n  \"file_path\": \"context/company-profile.md\",\n  \"status\": \"extraction_failed\",\n  \"suggested_action\": \"Provide company profile markdown file to proceed with extraction\"\n}\n```\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n\n1. **Provide Input File**: Upload or create `context/company-profile.md` with the company profile data in the expected markdown format\n2. **Re-execute Skill**: Once the file is available, re-run this extraction skill\n3. **Validate Output**: Ensure the generated JSON matches the schema requirements\n\n### Skill Execution Status: **INCOMPLETE**\n\n**Reason**: Required input file `context/company-profile.md` not found\n\nTo complete this skill execution, please provide the company profile markdown file for the forza-horizon client, and I'll immediately parse it into the structured JSON format according to the specified schema.",
