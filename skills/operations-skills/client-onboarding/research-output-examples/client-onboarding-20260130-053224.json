Since no specific inputs were provided, I'll simulate the full onboarding process.\n\n## Phase 1: Tech Stack Discovery\n\n### Step 1.1: Client Intake Questionnaire\n\nSince no client data was provided, I'll need to gather this information:\n\n```yaml\nclient_intake:\n  company:\n    name: \"Forza Horizon\"\n    industry: \"Gaming/Entertainment\"  # Assumed based on name\n    size: \"Unknown - requires input\"\n    \n  crm:\n    primary: \"Unknown - requires discovery\"\n    secondary: \"None specified\"\n    \n  data_infrastructure:\n    warehouse: \"Unknown - requires discovery\"\n    analytics: \"Unknown -

Credentials required\",\n    \"warehouse_discovery\": \"PENDING - Connection details required\", \n    \"identity_mapping\": \"PENDING - Platform access required\"\n}\n```\n\n## Phase 2: Capability Assessment\n\n### Step 2.1: Platform Support Check\n\n```yaml\nplatform_support_matrix:\n  # Gaming Industry Assumptions\n  -

gaming has unique metrics (DAU, session length, ARPU)\n- Need gaming-specific integrations for player behavior tracking\n```\n\n## Phase 2.5: Lifecycle Mapping\n\nFor gaming industry, I'll map typical gaming lifecycle stages:\n\n```yaml\nlifecycle_mapping:\n  gaming_funnel:\n    -
