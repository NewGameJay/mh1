MH1 Intelligence Content Domain Adapter

Scoring adapter for content and engagement metrics across platforms.
Handles social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram), email campaigns,
and other content types with platform-specific engagement rates and decay.

Content scoring considers:
- Impressions and reach
- Engagements (likes, comments, shares, clicks)
- Platform-specific baseline rates
- Content decay over time (viral half-life)
- Content type and format bonuses
- Paid vs organic performance

The Signal/Baseline formula for content:
    signal = impressions * (1 + engagement_rate)
    baseline = follower_count * platform_rate * decay_factor
    score = (signal / baseline) * context_multiplier

    Domain adapter for content and engagement scoring.
    
    Calculates performance scores for content across various platforms
    by comparing actual engagement against expected baselines based on
    audience size, platform norms, and content age.
    
    Platform-specific considerations:
    - LinkedIn: Professional content, slower decay, moderate engagement
    - Twitter: Fast-moving, rapid decay, lower engagement rates
    - Instagram: Visual content, moderate decay, higher engagement
    - Email: Direct channel, slow decay, highest engagement when opened
    
    The adapter handles both organic and paid content, with multipliers
    for content type (video > image > text) and sentiment.
