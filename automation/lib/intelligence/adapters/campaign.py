Campaign Domain Adapter for MH1 Intelligence System

This module implements the campaign-specific scoring adapter for marketing campaign
performance evaluation. It uses the universal scoring formula with campaign-specific
metrics centered around cost efficiency (inverse CPA) and ROI.

Campaign Efficiency Scoring:
---------------------------
The primary signal is cost efficiency, calculated as:
    Signal = conversions / spend * 1000 (inverse CPA, normalized)

This means higher scores indicate better cost efficiency:
- Lower CPA = Higher Signal = Better Performance
- A campaign spending $1000 for 20 conversions ($50 CPA) scores higher than
  one spending $1000 for 10 conversions ($100 CPA)

Baseline Calculation:
--------------------
Baselines are derived from channel-specific target CPAs and seasonal factors:
    Baseline = (1000 / target_cpa) * seasonal_factor

Channel-specific targets reflect industry benchmarks:
- Paid Search: $50 CPA (high intent, higher costs)
- Email: $10 CPA (owned channel, low cost)
- Display: $80 CPA (awareness, higher costs)

Seasonal adjustments account for:
- Q1: Post-holiday slowdown (0.9x)
- Q4: Holiday boost (1.15x)

ROI Calculation:
---------------
ROI is provided as a utility metric:
    ROI = (revenue - spend) / spend

Context Factors:
---------------
Multiple factors adjust the score:
- Funnel stage: Awareness (0.8), Consideration (1.0), Decision (1.3)
- Audience quality: Normalized 0-100 score to 0.8-1.2 multiplier
- Attribution model: First-touch (0.9), Last-touch (1.0), Multi-touch (1.1)
- Campaign maturity: <7 days (0.8), 7-30 days (1.0), 30+ days (1.1)

    Domain adapter for marketing campaign performance scoring.
    
    This adapter evaluates campaign efficiency using inverse CPA (cost per acquisition)
    as the primary signal. It supports various marketing channels with channel-specific
    baselines and incorporates seasonal factors, funnel stage, and attribution models.
    
    The scoring philosophy prioritizes cost efficiency:
    - Signal: How efficiently are we acquiring conversions? (1000 / CPA)
    - Baseline: What efficiency should we expect for this channel/season?
    - Context: How do funnel position, audience, and attribution affect expectations?
    
    Example Usage:
        >>> adapter = CampaignAdapter()
        >>> event = {
        ...     "spend": 1000,
        ...     "conversions": 25,
        ...     "channel": "paid_search",
        ...     "revenue": 5000
        ... }
        >>> context = {
        ...     "quarter": "q4",
        ...     "funnel_stage": "decision",
        ...     "attribution_model": "multi_touch"
        ... }
