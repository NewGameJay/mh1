"""
Customer Health Domain Adapter for MH1 Intelligence System

This adapter implements customer health scoring and churn risk assessment using
an RFM-inspired (Recency, Frequency, Monetary/Satisfaction) approach adapted
for SaaS customer health metrics.

The health score helps identify:
- At-risk customers requiring proactive intervention
- Healthy customers who may be candidates for expansion
- Patterns in customer behavior that predict churn or renewal

Scoring Formula:
    Signal = recency_score × frequency_score × (0.5 + satisfaction_score)
    Baseline = contract_tier_weight × age_factor × segment_retention_rate
    Context = support_factor × usage_factor × expansion_factor
    
    Final Score = (Signal / Baseline) × Context × Confidence

Risk Levels:
- high_risk: score < 0.3 (immediate intervention needed)
- medium_risk: score < 0.6 (monitor closely, proactive outreach)
- low_risk: score < 0.8 (healthy but room for improvement)
- healthy: score >= 0.8 (strong retention indicators)

The adapter considers multiple signals including:
- Activity recency and frequency
- NPS/satisfaction scores
- Support ticket volume
- Product usage percentile
- Account expansion/contraction signals
- Contract tier and customer tenure

    Domain adapter for customer health and churn risk scoring.
    
    This adapter transforms customer behavior signals into a health score

    commonly used in customer analytics, adapted for SaaS health metrics where
    "Monetary" is replaced with "Satisfaction" signals.
