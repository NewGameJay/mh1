This happens because of:Weak messaging: Your product's purpose is unclear, uninteresting, or irrelevant.Weak design: Your design is unprofessional, outdated, or ugly.We've written several hundred above-the-fold sections. We have data on what works.And that's what this playbook teaches you: how to rewrite and redesign your above-the-fold to increase conversion and make your brand stand out from your competitors.In a sense, this playbook isn't just about your ATF. It's about learning how to position your startup so that people get excited by it. The lessons herein improve your landing pages, ads, content, and how you present your startup to the world.Watch how we rewrite this headerOn the left, we have a bad example. Pay attention to what makes the right example better.The right one is better because:It no longer sounds like corporate speak.It describes the specific benefit of the product.A few more examplesThe right one is better because:It no longer uses vague phrasing.It describes the specific benefit of your product.Another:The right one is better because:It doesn't talk in self-congratulatory terms. It talks in terms of benefits to the visitor.It clarifies the specific outcome of using the product.What these improved examples have in common is increased specificity.Specificity is step one to strong ATF header writing.Step two is layering a hook into your header. Meaning, find what's magical and exciting about your startup, and write it in your ATF copy.For example: The startup below offers the educational equivalent of a university degree for just $19/mo. That's magical for an audience who gave up on higher education because it was unaffordable.Don't consider your landing page completed until you've found your startup's magic and pitched it in your header. It's how you get people to lean in and keep scrolling.These changes can increase conversion by 10-30%. That's significant.Over the next few sections we'll walk you through writing your own ATF from scratch.Our copywriting processThe first part of this guide covers writing the key text in your ATF: headers, subheaders, and call-to-action buttons.We'll follow three steps:Identify how users get value from your productAdd a hook—to get them to keep readingSpeak directly to your customer personasOptimizing your landing page is only one piece of the puzzle. How do you actually drive traffic to your landing pages? Paid ads is the approach that we recommend. We've run ads for 100+ startups. Check out Ad Labs.1. Identify how users get valueValue props are ways people "get value" from your product.Consider the following exercise for finding your product's value props:What bad alternative do people resort to when they lack your product?How is your product better than that bad alternative?Now turn the last step into an action statement—that's your value prop.As an example, let's use the free language learning app Duolingo. It offers short-form, interactive lessons.Let's look at a few more examplesAction itemsList the ways life is worse when your product doesn't exist.Identify a specific articulation of your better solution. Do not use vague phrasing.Now that we have our clear and specific header, we'll add a hook to compel visitors to keep reading.2. Add a hookAdding a hook to your header can take two forms:A bold claimA response to likely skepticismAdd a bold, specific claimOn the left, we have a vague statement. On the right, we have a specific, bold claim about the benefit users will receive.Now that's more enticing. Readers want to know how that's possible. So they keep reading.Here's another example:Be sure your pitch doesn't sound too good to be true. If you trigger the reader's hyperbole radar, it cheapens your brand and compromises their trust in you.For example, don't do this:In short, a bold claim is:Highly specificTriggers a dopamine hit of "wow, I didn't know that was possible."Proactively address major objectionsIn addition to including a bold claim, you can also add a hook by addressing a key objection in your header.Let's use the website design tool, Webflow, as an example. Below is their header copy, which hasn't yet been paired with a hook:Build your own website.Upon seeing this, objections readers have could include:But, I don't know how to code. Don't websites require coding skills?This will take too long. I don't have the time. I'm not a trained designer.This will be low functionality and constraining like other site design tools.Your job is to identify which of these is a major buying objection—and to proactively address it.Don't let visitors retain their unaddressed concerns that cause them to bounce before scrolling.In the examples above, we're expanding our header's first sentence plus adding a second—in pursuit of our handling a key objection.This requires balance. If you bloat your header with extraneous details, it becomes hard to read.Don't try to address every objection—you can do that with the rest of your page.Backing up, how do you go about identifying your customers' biggest objections? Survey them.Ask:"What almost stopped you from buying?" That's an objection."Why do you think non-customers haven't bought from us yet?" That's an objection.Let's revisit our earlier examples—this time with objection handling:Action itemsList out your customers' key objections when considering your product.Address those objections in your header through a bold claim and/or an objection-handling sentence.3. Speak directly to your customer personaSo far, we've captured the specific, major benefit of our product. And we've articulated it clearly without using vague language. Then, we added a hook to reel visitors in.Now, we have to make sure we're addressing our value prop to the right audience.If your target audience isn't everyone in the world—and it's probably not—then don't try to appeal to everyone in your header copy.When warranted, it's okay to go niche. Make your target persona know you're truly built for them.This is the discipline of persona marketing.In short, list who you're selling to, prioritize the list based on your business objectives and ROI, then directly address those personas in your ATF.Let's look at a subtle example:Before: tamagotchi.com, a site for children, is talking to adults who are presumably making the signup decision on behalf of their children. This is a misunderstanding of who's signing up for Tamagotchi. It's actually the children browsing on their own, not the adults.After: Now the children feel spoken to. The benefit is directed at them.If your product targets multiple major personas, you can prompt visitors to choose which persona they fit into at the top of your page. Then route them to the appropriate section of your site.We call this "choose your own adventure." In the example below, xealenergy.com creates different paths for apartment and workplace owners:Action itemsList out your top 2-3 customer personas.Rewrite your header(s) to speak to them—in their language.Choose the header that best addresses your key audience, or create multiple landing pages for each persona.Header writing recapFind what makes you magical then shape that into a specific, non-vague benefit.Add a hook. Either a bold claim or a major objection handled.Tailor your messaging to your major persona(s).That's the header writing process.On to the next step: SubheaderUntil now, we've only written a header. It's time to complement that with a subheader, which will expand on what makes our product special.The subheader is commonly used for expanding on two things:How does our product work exactly?Which of our features make our header's bold claim believable?In the example above, we address what our platform is (green) then we explain how its claim ("new way to grow your startup") is possible (blue).Similarly, jupiter.co's first sentence explains what their product is (green). Then it explains how its claim ("In just 5 minutes") is possible (blue).As a rule of thumb, your subheader should only be one or two sentences. Don't make this an essay. Keep reading breezy so visitors sustain their momentum.Time for a few more examplesAction itemsRewrite your subheader to explain how the claim in your header is achieved.Add the top 2-3 features of your product.Keep it brief. Lengthy paragraphs kill momentum.Designing your above the foldA landing page's design should rarely be unique. It's your product that should be unique. Your page is just a familiar medium for communicating your product's uniqueness.In other words, don't be aggressive with avant garde design—unless you have a branding-related reason to. (Which is fine.)Generally, stick with visual idioms readers are familiar with and are expecting.Incorporating imagesWhen adding images, consider two goals:Make them visually appealing—modern, clear, and pretty. Pay a designer if you aren't one.Have the images demonstrate the value of your product. This is often done by showing the product in action.In the example below, HelloSign includes a GIF of their product in action. It's showing us what we're about to sign up for. It's de-risking our time investment and removing the uncertainty.Further, instead of making the visitor read tiny text, they blur it out so you can focus on what matters: how the product works.One more good example. If you're selling physical goods, consider doing two things: (1) show off the various use cases and (2) show close-ups of the build quality. This gives visitors a fuller appreciation of the product's magic.Another tactic for ecommerce companies: If your product's packaging is aesthetically pleasing, consider displaying your product in its packaging. You might persuade more shoppers to click since they'll envision that moment of excitement when they unbox your product.Here's how 3 Leaf, a matcha company, does it:Negative spaceKeep plenty of empty space between the elements on your ATF. It'll help your copy and visuals pop.Below is a counter-example. The visuals here don't add value and they cause the header copy and subheader copy to blend into the background.Navigation barThe fewer links you have in your navigation bar, the better. Try to minimize analysis paralysis.Put the greatest visual emphasis on the key action you want visitors to take.Above, Slack has too many things going on. It's unclear where to start.Trello, in contrast, is possibly too minimal with their nav bar. There are likely additional resources that could help buyers build confidence to buy from Trello.Rule of Thumb: Use 2-4 links plus a CTA on home pages.CTA buttonsWe've hit the end of this guide. Before we wrap up, let's talk about "call-to-action" buttons:Above, we have two strong examples. "Find food" and "Start learning" are continuations of the magic teased in the header copy. It feels natural to click these CTAs because they help the visitor continue the narrative you kicked off.In short, think of your CTA as the actionable next step to fulfilling the claim in your header.In contrast, below is a weak CTA.The copy is vague and it's not explained what the product is, so why would I request a meeting?Rewriting CTA examplesSometimes the best CTA is to keep scrollingSome products are difficult to pitch. They may benefit from visitors reading more of the landing page before they click to sign up.If this describes your product, consider having your CTA button simply lead further down the page. Then have a CTA focused on converting further down the page.Or, instead of adding a CTA to keep scrolling, cut the above-the-fold short so visitors must scroll to see the rest.Let's recapYour above the fold starts a narrative. It provides visitors with the specificity, magic, and clarity to take the next action in your funnel.More importantly, it's your first impression. That warrants a lot of your attention.What we covered:Create a header by identifying how users "get value" from your product.Add a hook that has bold claims or handles objections.Talk directly to your key personas.Support your header's claim with a subheader explaining how your product works.Design your ATF to support your message: value-added images, minimal and focused navbars, and magic-relevant CTA buttons.<- Previous ChapterNext Chapter ->Become a better marketer, in minutes.Join the Growth Newsletter.

It means you don't have to compete on the same dimensions as the big players in your industry.From the start, Google's goal has been to serve users the most relevant results on the web. But the algorithm has fundamentally changed in the last few years—for the better. The days of spamming your way to the front page are ending, and high-quality content is finally starting to get the respect it deserves.How does SEO work in 2023Google's mission is to give searchers the information they're looking for, presented in the most helpful way, as quickly as possible.The nuances of Google's algorithm are too complex to dig into here, but we've distilled the process we believe Google uses to rank webpages into three phases:Phase 1. Technical SEO helps Google access, understand, and serve your content.Google can't rank your content if they can't find your content. Healthy technical SEO makes it easier for Google-bot (Google's webpage crawler) to crawl your site, find important pages, and give them greater visibility in the search engine results pages (SERPs). Starting from a baseline of good technical health means your site loads fast, is free of errors, and has a logical site structure. Phase 2. Topical authority helps Google determine where your content initially ranks.Google associates websites with topics that are related to their site's identity and overall business objectives. The strength of these associations is commonly known as topical authority. Google rewards sites with stronger associations (topical authority) with greater visibility in the SERP. To build topical authority in your niche, Google needs proof that you're a credible subject matter expert. There are two main ways to demonstrate this kind of expertise: ‍‍‍Content helps Google understand what topics a page should rank for and whether it fulfills the search intent for those keywords.‍Links have been an important ranking factor since the beginning. They help Google determine the relative authority of domains and specific pages. The more links, the more authoritative the page or site is.Phase 3. User engagement helps Google determine whether your content should continue ranking.This idea is controversial, but many experts now believe the algorithm looks at user engagement metrics to determine which pages are helpful to users and which aren't. We believe the most important indicator is whether a user has to return to Google to perform a subsequent search. Let's look at two common scenarios to see how this works.‍Scenario 1. You Google [email marketing], and click into the first result for a "what is" guide to email marketing. It's exactly what you're looking for. So helpful that you poke around the site for more insights.‍Scenario 2. You open the same article but this time the content isn't quite what you're looking for. So you click "back" and search for something more specific: [how to do email marketing].The behavior in Scenario 1 tells Google the first article was relevant to the search—it fulfilled the searcher's intent. Mission complete in Google's playbook. The behavior in scenario 2—returning to Google to perform another search—makes Google lose confidence in how relevant the page is to the original query (email marketing). As a result, Google questions whether a more relevant page should take its place.‍Key point: User behavior impacts rankingsBefore, you could rank generic "SEO content" provided you had enough links and on-page optimization. Now, unless you provide a premium content experience that ends the searcher's journey, you don't stand a chance of ranking for your target keyword in the top three positions.This is a fundamental shift in SEO because people are now the final judge of whether content is valuable or not, not just algorithms. Let that sink in.To succeed, your content has to appease the algorithm first (near-term ranking), then please the reader (long-term ranking).In this playbook, we'll teach you how to produce premium content for search. The kind that's engineered to rank, resonate, and convert—the kind your prospects actually enjoy reading, not just tolerate.Before we dive into the strategy, let's dispel a few common myths.SEO myths and misconceptions‍"More search volume means more conversions"‍Most companies still fixate on driving as much search traffic as possible. Usually, this means targeting competitive, high-search volume keywords with low conversion intent (top-funnel content). This approach is logical if you're a media company subsisting on page views and ad revenue. But for most businesses, it's an incredibly inefficient way to generate ROI from SEO. You'll drive more conversions targeting lower search volume, high intent keywords towards the bottom of the funnel. ‍"Bigger budgets drive better results"Big companies tend to scale as fast as possible, usually by investing in a high quantity of posts at the expense of quality. This strategy worked well when backlinks were the dominant ranking factor, but it's starting to lose its effectiveness. ‍Today's dominant ranking factors are relevance and quality—the core of content-led SEO. With the right content strategy, you can use your limited resources to produce less content and likely drive better business results. ‍"You'll never outrank the big players in the SERP"‍Many businesses assume they'll never outrank sites with big, scary domain ratings. This assumption is false. In many cases, current rankings reflect past strategies that are now outdated. You can often dethrone the incumbents by competing on dimensions with less competition—content and user experience.Three things marketers need to know about content-led SEO1. Think niche‍Your goal with content-led SEO is to demonstrate topical authority in the core topics your website is—and should be—known for. In practice, this means focusing on product-related keywords with clear search intent. To build defensible topical authority, cover the specific topic you want to be associated with from all angles and search intents. 2. Topics are the new keywords‍It used to be best practice to target one keyword per page, and you could expect that page to rank regardless of other content on your site. Now, it's best practice to target one topic per page—one unique search intent—and include relevant keywords (sub-topics and search perspectives) within that content. 3. Context is king‍Your content needs to fit the particular context associated with your target keywords. But context isn't limited to words on a page—you must create content experiences that engage users on multiple dimensions (e.g., video, images, widgets, testimonials) to fulfill search intent.What this playbook coversThis playbook teaches you how to execute a modern content-led SEO strategy. The nuances may evolve over time, but this strategy is evergreen.We interviewed some of the best SEO's on the planet to bring you the most concise, actionable, and up-to-date playbook possible—the 80/20 of modern-day SEO.And we sourced proven insights from SEO professionals at Grow and Convert, Minuttia, Graphite, among others, to get as close as possible to the source of truth. If you implement what we teach in the playbook, you'll get most of the results by doing less but better. You'll walk away knowing how to prioritize the next best action to take, whether that's performing targeted keyword research, creating original content, performing a content audit, or dialing in your site architecture—we teach it all. No fluff. Nothing that doesn't move the needle forward.Quick note: The team at Clearscope provided insights for this playbook.

Head over here to get your free reports.The best SEO content strategy prioritizes quality and depth, not volume and breadth. When successful, SEO, just like great content marketing, can:Drive consistent, ongoing traffic and leadsDevelop brand reputation and authorityGenerate compounding resultsYou'll need to work diligently to build strong topical authority in your niche to achieve these kinds of results for your business. Two kinds of topical authority to build:External topical authority: Involves activities that happen outside of your website. Also called "off-site SEO." Building external topical authority is an uphill battle; you don't have much control over the actions or the outcomes.Internal topical authority: Involves activities that happen on your website. Also called "on-site SEO." Building internal topical authority is high-leverage; you have complete control over the actions and, to a lesser degree, the outcomes. This playbook teaches you how to build internal topical authority with content.Content-led SEO is a quality-first, content-driven approach to building internal topical authority. And topical authority, as we discuss throughout the piece, is the key that unlocks rankings, search traffic, and ideally, conversions.The strategy and examples we share are specific to B2B SaaS SEO, but they can generally work for B2C as well. The strategy looks like this:Resolve major technical issuesGenerate keywordsAnalyze the SERP to inform content angle and structureWrite original SEO contentCreate a premium content experiencePlan your internal linking strategyOptimize and maintain your contentTrack performance1. Resolve major technical issuesTechnical SEO is a big deal for 1000+ page websites, or sites with programmatic SEO components (think: generated listings on Zillow, software reviews on G2, restaurant reservations on Tock). Fortunately, SaaS sites are uncomplicated. And most of you reading this are using modern CMS platforms and website builders that handle the basic technical requirements for you right out of the box.For more details on optimizing your technical baseline, go read and bookmark our technical SEO quick start guide. We wrote the doc so you can implement the recommended actions yourself or hand it to a developer to do the work for you.Here's a high-level overview of what's covered in the guide.AccessThese factors let Google access and prioritize your library of URLs.Sitemap.xml: an inventory of URLs that lets search engines find, crawl, and index pages on your site.Robots.txt file: this text file instructs search crawlers on how to crawl your site.Internal links: links on your website that shape site architecture and help users navigate to other pages on your site.Site architecture: describes how your website is structured and organized.UnderstandFactors that tell Google which topics your content is associated with.Title tags and subheadings: HTML snippets that help Google understand what your content is about.Schema markup (structured data): snippets of code that give Google more information about how to represent your content in SERPs when added to your web pages.ServeFactors that signal user-friendliness, trust, and security.Mobile usability: use responsive web design, disable intrusive pop-ups, and optimize page speed.Security: always use "https://" > "http://"Site "cleanliness:" e.g., fix broken links, limit 301 redirects, remove 404s, 500sCore web vitals: page load speed, interactivity, visual stability.Again, the technical cheat sheet covers these factors in greater detail. 2. Generate keywordsThis is the longest section in this playbook but also one of the most important to get right. In this section, you'll build a keyword roadmap for your content strategy. The process has three steps:Step 1: See what keywords are already working for youStep 2: Generate a list of keywords Step 3: Sort and prioritize keywordsBy the end, you'll have a list of high-opportunity keywords and content ideas to go after. Pain point SEO: a conversion-focused approach to keyword researchConsider two different approaches to keyword research:‍Approach #1: Top-down‍The traditional "scorched earth" approach to keyword research. You start at the top of the funnel, build out a giant list of TOFU keywords, then move down the funnel to keywords with higher conversion intent.The top-down method is a volume play. It assumes you must create content that nurtures prospects from the awareness stage of the funnel to conversion.Credit: Grow and ConvertApproach #2: Bottom-up‍Start by identifying your prospects' main questions and pain points, then find relevant keyword opportunities that address those topics. Grow and Convert coined this bottom-up strategy "Pain Point SEO" because it prioritizes intent—keywords with real business value. Pain point SEO is ideal for B2B because it prioritizes mid and bottom-funnel keywords that indicate that the searcher is either:Researching a solution to solve a pain pointActively looking to buy a productBy focusing on high-intent keywords around customer pain points, your content will have a much better chance of converting people immediately, even if the search volume is low. Before we move on, make a copy of this keyword research template. Open it in another tab so you can add keyword ideas to your spreadsheet as you go.Step 1. See what keywords are already workingNote: This step is only helpful if you've already run Google Ads campaigns or you have several months of data accumulated in Google Search Console (GSC). If you just launched a new website or haven't set up GSC yet, skip this step. But before you do, set up your GSC account for the future. It only takes two minutes.Google Search ConsoleGoogle Search Console (GSC) is a free search analytics tool that shows which keywords you're already getting impressions and clicks for. The keywords in GSC indicate the topics that Google associates your business with right now. Consider focusing on these topics first since it will be easier to gain more visibility for keywords you are already ranking for than starting with a new topic. Here's what to do: In GSC, click on your domain and then Performance to see real-time data around your site's key search metrics.Set the date to Last three months and check the colored boxes for Total Clicks, Average Impressions, Average CTR, and Average Position.Next, export the search data to a .csv file by clicking on the Export button at the top-right of the page.Now, you have the list of search queries you're already ranking for. Copy and paste your data into your "Google Search Console" spreadsheet column.Step 2. Generate keywordsThere are many ways to generate keywords. Here are the methods we'll focus on:BrainstormingGoogle hacksCustomer researchCompetitive analysisFor the rest of this playbook, we'll use brackets when referencing a keyword. For example, content marketing expressed as a keyword is [content marketing].Step 2a. BrainstormConsider your customer persona and list all the ways they might search and discover your business on Google.You'll find many more opportunities to create content on relevant topics that aren't limited to your product or service but are still tangentially related. Use your intuition and ask questions like:What is your website content about?What would you ask a search engine to find what your website offers?What do you think other searchers would ask for?What are your most popular pages/items about?For example, if your product is a content optimization tool, your target audience might search:[content optimization tool][content optimization software][content optimization system][content optimization platform][best content optimization tool][seo content optimization tool][content optimization tool in digital marketing]Next, think about your product's value props and brainstorm ideas based on the problem your product solves. Continuing with the above example, value prop keywords for a content optimization tool might include:[how to optimize content for seo][how to create content that ranks][how to write content for seo][how do you write relevant content][how to build topical authority][how to write seo friendly content]Once you have a list of potential keywords, add them to your spreadsheet's "Brainstorm" column.Step 2b. Google hacksAutosuggestGoogle Autosuggest is an incredible hack to discover valuable keywords you might not find in popular keyword tools.Head to Google, enter some of the keyword phrases you previously generated, and see what autocomplete suggests. These suggestions are based on what users search, so you can easily find out other keywords related to your product.NFTs are popular now, so let's use that as an example. Let's say you built an NFT creation SaaS that helps people turn their artwork into NFTs on the blockchain. An artist wanting to make NFTs out of her artwork might search for:How-to's: How do I make an nft out of my art? (Top-funnel, researching what the process involves)Comparisons: Ethereum versus Solana to make an nft (Mid-funnel, they likely have an idea and are deciding on a platform to use)Questions: What is the best software on Ethereum to create nft art? (Bottom-funnel, they likely already have artwork in mind and are looking for a SaaS to help turn it into NFTs)Look for relevant keywords and add them to your spreadsheet's "Google hacks" column—these are the keywords you should target.People also ask and Related searchesWhen you're exploring Autosuggest ideas, look at People also ask and Related searches as well. These features will give you a more layered understanding of the nuances around search intent for your topics. Advanced search operatorsAdvanced search operators let you see the number of indexed pages from any domain, among other useful things. You can use search operators to determine how often competitors mention your target keyword in their content. Search operators can also help you discover valuable keyword ideas.For example, if your topic was link-building, you could search for link building Reddit threads in the r/SEO/ subreddit.If you want to find out which pages include your target keyword in their title or URL, use the "intitle:" or "inurl:" modifier.This hack can give you an idea of how many pages a given domain has targeting your specific topic. It also tells you how many pages you may need to compete effectively.Step 2c. Perform customer researchCustomer research is one of the best ways to uncover specific pain points. Since these are usually mid-to-bottom funnel topics, they'll likely be some of the highest-converting keywords in your list.Online forums and communitiesLook for communities and forums where people discuss topics related to your product, like Reddit and Quora. Then enter their URLs into your keyword tool to find out what keywords they rank highly for. For example, according to Ahrefs, one Reddit post at r/Entrepreneur ranks #4 in search results for the keyword phrase "starting a business with 50k". Googling the phrase confirms this, showing Quora and Reddit pages at the top of organic search results. There's a clear interest in this question—consider how many questions have been asked about it on two platforms—but few landing pages and blog posts dedicated to answering it. Create an email autoresponder Another way to get a steady flow of content ideas is to ask new email subscribers to share a significant pain point or problem they're trying to solve.At Demand Curve, we ask new subscribers to reply and share their biggest growth problem.This feedback loop helps us better understand our audience and informs our content. You can get a ton of quality feedback with barely any effort.Talk to your customersYou can learn about your customers with research. You can also learn from them directly.Here are some questions Grow and Convert recommends asking your customers via interviews, phone calls, and surveys: What was the problem you were looking to solve before stumbling across our product or service?  If our product/service were no longer to exist, what product/service would you use as an alternative? How would you describe our product/service to a friend who knew nothing about us? What are the top 3 benefits you receive from our product/service? What would you search for if you were to research our product or service? If you can't or don't feel comfortable interacting with customers directly, consider speaking with different departments in your organization to get closer to their pain points and feelings about your product or service.Talk to your teamThe best pieces of content you will create are often the ones you find yourself answering in sales calls and customer support tickets.Here's a handful of questions to ask your team, organized by department:Customer service/supportCan you give me some examples of your best customers? Who are they, and why do you feel like they're the best for you?Can you tell me the most common use cases for which people use your products/service?What do you feel like your competitive advantage is compared to all of the other alternatives out there?What are some top questions you get asked on customer phone calls?Sales Tell me about a recent conversation you had with a prospect. What was the challenge they were trying to solve?What was the last prospect/company you had an easy time closing? What was the problem that person was trying to solve? Why do you think that person signed with you?What alternative products/services have prospects compared you to?Tell me about the competition. What do you think your competitive advantage is over other companies?Are there specific industries or customers you've noticed are an excellent fit for the product/service?Product What feature set and/or part of the service do customers use most?What are the most common use cases of the product/service?Parse the dataWhen you're done, take notes on your collected answers and look for patterns, commonalities, and disconnects. Turn the most common use cases, questions, and problems customers try to solve into content ideas.Once you have a list of topics and questions, search for keywords that tie into those pain points and intents. Step 2d. Competitor analysisUnderstand what content you need to create by assessing what terms your competitors are ranking for on Google. Enter your competitors' URLs into your keyword research tool. This could be their homepage or any relevant blog posts. Your keyword tool will show a list of keywords your competitors' pages rank for. For Ahrefs, you can do this with the Site Explorer feature under the Organic keywords section.Export the data as a .csv file and add those keywords to the "Competitor analysis" column in your spreadsheet.Repeat this process for every competitor that comes to mind.Step 3. Sort and prioritize high-opportunity keywordsStep 3a. Sort keywordsYou'll probably notice similar phrases as you go through your keyword data. Since users search for topics using different wording, some terms are variations with the same intent. In which case, a single piece of content can target all of them—these are called topic clusters.  Here's how to organize your keyword data into topic clusters:Group related keywords. Keywords belong in the same cluster if the intent behind them is identical or very similar.In each cluster, identify the primary keyword. This keyword is the overarching theme of the cluster and is usually the keyword with the highest search volume.For the other keywords, categorize them as secondary and tertiary keywords. These keywords relate to the primary one but have lower search volume and relevance.For example, check out this topic cluster about sending money abroad:

	
		
			Keyword
      Monthly search volume
		
	
	
		
			Send money abroad
			590
		
		
			How can I send money internationally
			210
		
		
			How to send money abroad
			170
		
		
			How to send money abroad without fees
			20
		
      
			How long does it take to send money abroad
			20
	

Based on this data, creating content targeting "send money abroad" as your primary keyword makes sense. Related keywords like "how to send money abroad without fees" and "how long does it take to send money abroad" are less popular but still relevant, so they should be secondary/tertiary.Recommended third-party tool: Keyword InsightsKeyword Insights is a premium tool that analyzes your list of keywords and groups them into topic clusters for you. If you're managing a high volume of keywords, this tool can save you a ton of time.For a tutorial on how to use it, check out this 8-minute tutorial video from Andy Chadwick, the creator.Step 3b. Prioritize high-opportunity keywordsFinally, prioritize your list to surface keywords that will have the highest business impact based on monthly search volume, stage of the funnel, and intent.If you're currently running a Google Ads campaign, copy and paste your long list of keywords into Keyword Planner and click on "Get search volume and forecasts."The tool will sort your keywords by the estimated monthly search volume. Export the list, and copy and paste the "keyword" and "avg. monthly" columns into your spreadsheet.If you aren't running ads, upload your keyword list to Keyword Explorer in Ahrefs or your tool of choice.Export the data from Ahrefs, then copy and paste the "Keyword" and "Volume" columns into your spreadsheet.As you sort through your list, pay special attention to high-intent and non-purchase intent keywords that indicate the right audience.3. Analyze the SERP to inform content angle and structureNow that you have a list of high-opportunity keywords to go after, you can figure out what types of pages you'll need to make for them.In this section, you'll learn how to analyze the search engine results page (SERP) for key associations. You'll then use these associations to inform what type of content you should create to rank. What does the search query deserve?Google has gotten really good at predicting SERPs that users care about. When considering which pages to surface, Google looks at factors like search intent, page type, and content.Here's the SERP for the keyword [saas].[Saas] is ambiguous, with no qualifiers whatsoever to help Google understand what the searcher is looking for. However, through ongoing experimentation, Google understands that people searching for [saas] want broad, high-level informational content about SaaS, the concept, not product recommendations or help troubleshooting software issues.Looking closer, we can make an educated guess that most domains in the SERP have topical authority in the software space (tech companies like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Red Hat). You can use the site search operator we showed you earlier to get a sense of a website's topical authority—the strength of its association with a particular subject matter.Using Salesforce as an example, the site search hack tells us how many pages on their site mention the keyword [saas]. 8,270 pages is quite a lot! However, since [saas] is SO broad, we can refine our search to title tags only.951 Salesforce pages have SaaS in the title—still a ton of pages.In summary: Our initial SERP analysis for the keyword [saas] tells us we would need to meet the following hard associations to rank:Create the right content experience: a high-level blog or article talking about SaaS as a concept.Requires strong topical authority: we would need strong authority in the software category (hundreds, if not thousands of unique pages mentioning [saas] in the content and/or title tag).We call these "hard" associations because they are the minimum requirements to rank. Without them, you will never rank.Soft associations, on the other hand, aren't strict requirements. Soft associations are common elements that Google thinks provide the best user experience during the search. Depending on the topic, soft associations could include: Title tag Topic perspective/angleMultimediaSocial proofTrust factors (e.g., reviews, credentials, data, citations)User-generated contentInteractive content (widget, tools, quizzes)And moreExamples of soft associations for [saas] include: Page experience is a topic cluster (what is a SaaS, examples, how does it work)Page experience is a news articleContent experience is videoContent experience is written textPage includes "What is SaaS" in the title tagPage includes "Guide" in the title tagPutting it all together:Every result in the SERP for [saas] includes all of the required hard associations but only a handful of soft associations.Four evergreen pages to focus on in your B2B SEO content strategyB2B differs from other industries because recency isn't a factor; topics don't change very often. That means the range of content types is relatively small and predictable. We see the following four page types repeatedly in B2B SaaS companies:Topic clustersResource/article pagesComparison/review pagesProduct pages/use case pagesMany if not all of the high-opportunity keywords in your list should fit into one of these four "buckets."Your job as a marketer is to pair the most relevant page experience with the correct SERP associations and plan your content accordingly.Let's look at each example and analyze what they do well so you can learn from them.1. Product/use case page (high priority - bottom funnel content)​​Product pages are used to showcase your product's key features.Common keyword variations include:"Best [use case] software""[Use case] software""[Industry] software"“[Industry] + [Use case] software”"[Use case] software for [Industry]""[Industry] software for [Use case]"These are high-intent, bottom-funnel keywords. Searchers are actively looking for a particular type of SaaS product.In some cases, these keywords, and variations of them, might produce a SERP that includes both product pages and homepages. For example, the SERP for the keyword [online booking system] serves a mix of both page types.If your business is an online booking SaaS, you could create either page type and still rank, as long as you optimize the content according to the intent and provide a great user experience.SimplyBook.me's homepage currently ranks in the #2 position for [online booking system].When you see mixed results in the SERP, but both page types appear to satisfy search intent, here's how you might determine which format to choose:One core product feature/use case. If your product is a dedicated appointment scheduling SaaS—and will always be one— you could safely optimize your homepage for the keyword because it is unlikely to change over time.Multiple features/case cases. If appointment scheduling is one feature among many, or you plan on adding new features that aren't related to appointment scheduling, then you'd want to create a use case/product page. It's essential to consider the long-term goals of your business and choose a page type that aligns with those goals. Best practices for B2B product pages:Showcase the key features of your softwareClear CTAs with request demo or pricing detailsSocial proof with testimonials from key customers and logosAnswer all the frequently asked questions about your software, specifically. Since homepages and use case landing pages are typically templates, the FAQ section is an excellent opportunity to discuss the details and answer questions.2.  Product comparison and review pages (medium priority - mid-funnel)Comparison/review pages are usually list posts that compare and contrast products in your niche. They're meant to convince readers that your product is the one that they should talk to sales about. [brand] vs. [competitor] pages are a staple in B2B SEO.Like product page keywords, comparison keywords tend to follow the same pattern over and over again.Comparison keyword variations:"[competitor] vs [brand]""[competitor] alternatives"Review keyword variations:“Best [Use case] tools”“Best [Use case] apps”“Best [Use case] software for [integration]”“[Use case] software for [business size]” (SMB, enterprise, etc.)“[Business size] [Use case] tools”These are some of the best keywords to target because the searcher already wants a product in your category. They're looking for a list of the best options to help them make an informed buying decision.Insight: Don't be afraid to promote your product first Most companies sneak their product in at the end of a (usually) very long list of competing products. At some point, it became a best practice to downplay your product if you weren't promoting it on a landing page or product page. On blog posts, in particular, it's generally thought to be too salesy. We disagree for two reasons:Reason #1: Most people aren't going to read to the bottom of your page, which means you're missing out on potential leads by leaving your product for last place.Reason #2: People reading this type of content are actively searching for a product like yours. So why wouldn't you position yourself at the top of the list? If you sell a quality product and are honest about the factors it fulfills, there's no reason to dance around the subject. Put yourself first and own it.Use comparison pages to communicate how your product is better than the alternative. To do it right:Be specific: Most comparison pages don't go into nearly as much depth as they should. This is your chance to cover the details and nuances that differentiate your product from competitors. If you aren't sure what points to emphasize, think about what you can say that your competitors can't. This will force you to flush out general benefits and points that any of your competitors could make. Be specific.Be honest: If your product has strong positioning and unique value props, and is genuinely differentiated from competitors, those are the points you should focus on when evaluating your product against the alternatives. Your product probably isn't right for everyone. If you're forthright about your product's strengths and limitations, readers will trust you for it.Look at this example comparison page from Buddy Punch, which ranks #1 for the keyword [best employee tracking software].This is one of the strongest comparison page examples we've seen. Here's why we like it:1. Engaging multimediaImages and video can enhance the overall content experience for users, improving engagement signals and, ultimately, rankings. Instead of using stock imagery and product images from competitors' websites, Buddy includes high-quality multimedia like third-party video reviews, written user reviews, and many original in-app screenshots. Together, these elements make the piece vastly more engaging. ‍2. Relevant above-the-fold experience‍People searching for this keyword have an advanced understanding of employee time tracking software. They know what this class of products does and why they need it for their business. At this point, they're looking for the best option. Buddy addresses two relevant pain points straightaway in the introduction and tells readers the post will help them decide on "the best… solution for your specific needs." And most importantly, the content delivers on the expectations they set at the outset.3. Recommendations based on experience‍People are looking for advice and a trusted recommendation, but most companies take a neutral stance for some reason. Listing the pros and cons of a bunch of products isn't as helpful as someone who knows the industry, guiding you through the options in a thoughtful, informed way. 4. Written for an advanced reader‍Finally, the content is nuanced, specific, and comprehensive. Content is written in the first person, weaving in relevant experience and opinions on features, problems, and the space. This quality of content is rare because it is so specific, which is exactly what an advanced reader wants: an honest and comprehensive critique of competing products. This builds massive trust.3. Resource/article (low priority - top funnel)Resource pages are educational posts covering a specific subtopic within a broader subject.You'll see these search modifiers over and over again in keywords where the intent is to learn something or solve a specific problem:Information: How, what, who, where, why Insights: Tips, examples, benefits, tactics, ideas, help, best, metrics, strategySpecific resources: Guide, tutorial, resource, process, template, cheatsheet, formula, frameworkThe main criticism of resource pages is that they don't convert well, which is valid. That's why we recommend starting with bottom-funnel pages first, then moving up to higher funnel topics later.However, resource pages are still valuable because they help build topical authority. You can use educational blog posts and articles to support or "power-up" topic clusters targeting more competitive head terms. For instance, a topic cluster targeting [content marketing] would benefit from 10-20 supporting resource pages, each expanding on a particular subtopic within the broader content marketing theme.For example, Jobscan targets the keyword [ats friendly resume template]. Jobscan is a SaaS product that helps job applicants optimize their resumes to get in front of more job recruiters. Topic-wise, [ats-friendly resume template] is a good choice because the intent is so specific and relevant to Jobscan's core theme. Here's what the page does well:1. The content matches the dominant search intent. A quick SERP analysis tells us that the searcher is looking for free templates and/or advice on how to write an ATS-friendly resume. The dominant search intents are clear, and Jobscan fulfills both in their article. 2. Content is comprehensive. Jobscan digs into the nuances of proper resume formatting and includes 20 template options to choose from.3. Serves a relevant above-the-fold content experience. This article gets straight to the point, like the Buddy Punch example from earlier. The writer doesn't bore readers with the basic information they already know (e.g., what is an applicant tracking system?). 4. Engages readers with multimedia. This is a short article, so there isn't much space to add media elements. However, Jobscan includes an original explainer video towards the top of the page, which helps engage the reader early on. This makes the visit more valuable to the business and more memorable to the user.4. Topic clusters (low priority - top funnel)As we mentioned, topic clusters are the ideal content type for competitive, high-level category terms (e.g., content marketing) because they address several different intents in one piece. They often have a "complete guide" or "ultimate guide" angle.The strategy is to build topic clusters for high-level keywords and link out to separate resource pages that expand on particular subtopics related to those high-level terms. Here's a great topic cluster example that ranks #1 for the keyword [applicant tracking system].What Jobscan does well:1. Content covers the broadest range of topics the user will likely care about within the topic cluster theme. This post is a collection of short sections, no more than a few sentences each, that start to cover a subtopic, then link to a relevant resource in case the reader wants to learn more. This linking strategy is ideal for two reasons:It's genuinely helpful to the reader. The topic is extensive, and rather than overwhelm the reader with information, each section gives the reader a relevant resource to learn more about topics that interest them the most.It's more likely to end the search journey. Because contextual links are to relevant resources, users are more likely to explore Jobscan.co instead of clicking back to Google and visiting a different search result—a negative engagement signal. This example is what ending the searcher's journey looks like in practice. Give the searcher a rich content experience, anticipate the questions they'll have, and create linkable resources on your website that answer those questions. 2. Intent-specific sections link out to standalone pieces of content. All but a handful of links point to internal pages on jobscan.co. This section alone links out to seven relevant resource pages.This is just one subheading out of many. The post links to ~20 supporting resources with a unique search intent. Do you see how powerful topic clusters can be for building topical authority? The internal linking strategy optimizes PageRank distribution and relevance throughout these closely-related pages, encouraging Google to associate the domain with the broader topic [applicant tracking systems]. To pull back the curtain even further, when we perform an advanced site search, we can see that Jobscan.co has 584 pages associated with the keyword [applicant tracking system]. Your turn:Analyze the SERP for every keyword in your list to pair the most relevant content experience with the correct associations to fulfill search intent. Here's a recap of the steps:Step 1. Start at the top of your keyword list and type that keyword into GoogleStep 2. Analyze the top 10-30 results and look for associationsWhich page types appear in the SERP? What is the dominant searcher intent?What are the hard associations? What are the soft associations? Step 3. Identify the ideal page type and correct associations.What is the dominant page type in the SERP?What multimedia elements do you see?What intents are being serviced in the headlines and content?What trust or credibility factors do you see?With practice, you'll be able to analyze the SERP faster and learn to make decisions using your intuition. 4. Write original SEO contentThe SERPs are a dumping ground for "Google research papers" and what Grow and Convert calls "mirage content."Mirage content is when content looks useful on the surface, but upon closer inspection, you realize it's nothing but high-level fluff. Most content on the internet is like this.The hard truth about content marketing is that there are no shortcuts. No one has the patience for unoriginal, surface-level junk. If you want people to read and convert on your content, it must stand out and be original. How to write content that ranks and converts readers into leads and customersIt's beyond the scope of this playbook to teach you how to write well.But if you'd like to learn, we strongly recommend reading Animalz and Grow and Convert's backlog of articles. Julian's handbook, Write Well, is another exceptional resource :)Between the three, you're getting a free masterclass in writing on the internet. Take advantage of the education.If you already have basic content writing chops (or you have capable writers on board), then you can implement the following tactics immediately to turn a piece of generic content into standout content.1. Fulfill the requirements from your SERP analysisOn-page optimization still matters, although its importance has diminished over the years.Since this is SEO we're talking about, sometimes you still need to include general content to rank—the basic on-page requirements. If, for example, during your SERP analysis, you notice that each of your competitors has a section on best practices, examples, and key metrics, then you should also include those sections. Insight: When evaluating the quality of your content, remember that it's not about how good a post is in the abstract but how good it is relative to the other pages that are ranking. ‍Fulfilling the basic SEO requirements you determine via SERP analysis helps ensure that your content starts on equal footing.2. Enhance content with specificitySpecificity is the critical element your content needs to impress a target customer, and including it will produce better content.Most SEO content lacks specificity because it's written by content writers, not subject matter experts. You can't write nuanced content that goes deep into product features and comparisons when all your sources are Google articles. This makes for generic, surface-level content.To make your content stand out, roll up your sleeves and dig into your topic's nitty-gritty details to show people you know what you're talking about.3. ​​Include "originality nuggets" to stand apartIf your content meets the basic requirements for your keyword and has specificity, then all you need is an element of originality to stand apart from the competition. Adding originality to your content doesn't have to be some major undertaking. But you do need a handful of "originality nuggets"—small chunks of uniqueness—to stand apart.Note: The following tactics are arranged from least effort to most effort. Depending on the topic and resources, you can choose accordingly. 3.1 Take a contrarian viewpointWhen every headline in the SERP has the same perspective, taking a contrarian viewpoint can demonstrate your expertise and help you stand out in the SERP.If you take a contrarian position, make sure to fulfill the correct search intent and support your position with solid arguments and evidence. Otherwise, you're just click baiting people.3.2 Share your unique perspectiveAs we mentioned earlier, most writers adopt a neutral position in the pieces they write. They don't take sides or voice strong opinions. This kind of content isn't memorable and doesn't help to build trust. You can stand apart by sharing a genuine perspective.Buddy Punch does an excellent job of this. The example below is subtle, but notice how the writer speaks in the first person, sharing a specific experience and a genuine opinion on the topic—employee time tracking software.This type of content can also be considered thought leadership content. They're sharing an earned opinion, not a borrowed one. When you write about your experience and expertise in the subject, the content feels more authentic, which builds trust. Rather than discussing a topic in the abstract, weave in your unique perspective and experience. Why did you (or your founder/CEO) start the company? What experiences motivated you to build the product the way you did?What is your unique perspective on the industry you operate in? What problems are you/your product uniquely positioned to solve?3.3 Interview an expertIf you can't come up with an element of originality yourself, find someone with original ideas or industry insights and interview them instead.This article on patreon.com ranks for the keywords [best patreon business models] and [patreon ideas]. Yes, it helps tremendously that the article is published on Patreon, but that's not why we chose this example. We chose it because of its quality.The article shares the same information about Patreon's different business models as the other articles, but this writer went further. Each section has a specific story attached to it. The writer interviewed someone at Patreon to learn about their business first-hand and get examples from successful creators on Patreon.It takes more work, but your content will be more original and harder to replicate.3.4 Conduct original research and share your findingsThis type of originality takes the most work out of any of the nuggets on the list. It involves doing some work before you sit down to write.For example, the CRO firm, Growth Rock, spent months analyzing client data to determine what percentage of ecommerce websites use certain features in their mobile checkout flow.They analyzed data from over 40 clients and dumped it all into a spreadsheet that looked like this:Then, they created colorful graphs and custom graphics to present their findings.Growth Rock wrote the page over two years ago, but it still ranks #3 for the keyword [mobile checkout best practices].Written content is the foundation of your SEO strategy, but you can't rely on text alone for a user-friendly experience.You need to create a premium content experience that entices visitors to read, engage, and internalize the information on multiple dimensions.5. Create a premium content experienceRemember, user engagement is the "make or break" ranking factor. It's also far less competitive than other dimensions like domain authority and written content. In this section, we'll look at several on-page elements you can add to your pages to create a high-quality content experience.Here are some of the highest-leverage areas to focus on:Jump linksAuthor bios and about pagesContent structureMultimedia and interactive contentJump linksWhenever possible, include jump links in your content. These are internal links that take users to a specific part of a web page. You can create them by assigning that particular location with an ID and using a # in your link:<a id="link-destination">where your link takes users</a><a href="#link-destination">jump link</a>Jump links are often used in tables of contents and make your content more easily navigable, especially long pieces of content. Check out how Buffer formats its guides with a sticky table of contents.From an SEO perspective, jump links help tell Google what your content is about. They may also appear in SERPs, giving additional info to users and making your content more enticing. Another perk of including jump links, specifically in a table of contents: You can use a heat mapping tool like Hotjar to find out where users are clicking most often. Based on this info, you could reorganize your content to place this info more prominently or add CTAs to those specific sections.Author bios and about pagesGoogle looks at a website's E-A-T—the expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness of its creator—to evaluate its quality. This is one reason why articles from Mayo Clinic rank higher than no-name websites prescribing unverified medical advice.Some SEOs have observed that including author bios with their degrees/certifications can lead to a ranking boost. This doesn't mean Google ranks sites based on author reputation, though. It's because users perceive sites with this information as more credible, which also makes them more likely to share.Key point: Author info provides transparency to readers and builds your brand's credibility. Even if you don't have a specialized degree, having an author bio builds trust—more than an authorless piece of content would. Google's Quality Rater Guidelines even acknowledge that not all topics require formal expertise. For example, detailed restaurant or product reviews can be high quality even if they don't come from food critics or product experts.Content structureThoughtful formatting makes it easier for visitors to consume your content. Use paragraph breaks every 4-5 lines to help readers scan for important content and takeaways.Use these tactics to structure your content for scannability:Bullet points: Bulleted sections and lists help readers digest the information and remember it, which makes their experience more worthwhile.‍Subheadings: Subheadings are the section headers that break up your content. They're arranged hierarchically, with a single h1 title, h2 subheadings, followed by h3s, h4s, and so on. ‍Narrow post width: Narrow columns are easier to read. Google recommends keeping the width of your content to 700 - 800 pixels (about 8 - 10 words, depending on font size). ‍Comfortable font size: Choose a font size that's easy to read. Studies show that reading ability and comprehension increase in the 18 - 22 point range. Use WhatFont to check your font size and type. Multimedia and interactive content Images, video, and other forms of media help make a website more engaging than if it were purely text. Still, you should optimize these assets for a better overall page experience.Consider experimenting with the following media elements to give readers more opportunities to engage with your content.VideoIf you have the resources, consider producing a high-quality video version of the written content. Embed it towards the top of the page to engage visitors early on. If creating an original video isn't an option, find a quality video on YouTube. You can safely add it to your page if it's relevant, and you credit the owner.Jobscan produced a simple explainer video with the headline, "10 Ways to Beat the ATS." The article talks about how to write a resume that passes the ATS, and the video complements the topic, which enhances the experience and makes the visit more valuable.Quizzes and assessmentsQuizzes, evaluations, and assessments work because they're interactive, educational, and help the user make an informed decision. These aren't as common in B2B, but they can work well as lead gen assets in the proper context.Legion asks visitors about their diet and activity preferences to curate custom product recommendations.Tools and widgetsPeople love shortcuts. If you can create an asset that saves people time, effort, money, or brain power, you're likely going to see a ton of engagement. Tools are also hard to reproduce (most companies aren't willing to go above and beyond), which makes them valuable link bait.Pilot learned their customers were interested in figuring out their burn rate. [Burn rate calculator] was a popular search term on that topic, so they designed and coded a simple burn rate calculator, complete with charts and descriptions. The page currently ranks #4 for [burn rate calculator].Images and graphicsUnique images and graphics are a medium-effort way to add more uniqueness to your content. Use them over stock photos as much as you can.Buddy Punch is a SaaS we looked at earlier. They use unique screenshots to demonstrate that they've used the products in their employee time tracking SaaS comparison page. Better Up creates original graphics to help readers retain key concepts and frameworks discussed in the content.Including original media will make your content look sharper, and readers will value it more. Use a service like Design Pickle to create custom graphics for your content. 6. Plan your internal linking strategyThis quote is long, but it's worth including in full:"Backlinks are like the wires from a power plant to your house, and internal links are the wires from your circuit breaker to your outlets. No matter how many wires you have in your home, your lights won't work if you don't connect your house to the grid.Similarly, if you build an extra bedroom in your home but forget to wire it, that room won't have any power even if the rest of the house does. In that way, broken links are a lot like wires too. If you cut a wire, or the circuit breaker gets tripped, power won't flow to the outlets on the other end." - Jonas SicklerIf you understand the wires metaphor above, you understand internal linking.While this metaphor beautifully illustrates the concept of internal links in terms of PageRank (link equity), it doesn't fully convey the benefits of a well-designed internal linking strategy. Here are four ways internal linking can benefit your overall SEO strategy:Site architecture: Internal links group related pages and sections together, which reinforces context and topical depth. Both of which help build topical authority.Content hierarchy: Internal links help Google understand the most important pages of your website. Search engines view pages with more links as more essential than those with fewer links.Context: Google understands what pages are about by reading on-page SEO elements like title tag, URL, and subheadings. This provides context. Internal links also provide context through anchor text, the context of the link within a sentence or paragraph, and the subheading of the referring page. Authority: Pages on your website that receive the most backlinks have the most PageRank value to pass to other URLs. If a page has lots of inbound links, you can use internal links to distribute that authority to other pages on your website.A strong internal linking strategy distributes PageRank and topical relevance to the pages that matter most to your business. The strategy has three parts:URL architecture (site structure)Strong internal linkingNatural and unbiased anchors1. URL architectureStrong URL architecture is the foundation of good SEO. It describes how a website is structured, which affects how both users and Google-bot explore it. A clear URL structure makes it easy to browse your site more efficiently.Websites with poor URL structure are disorganized. Visitors get lost in them; it's not easy to find what they're looking for. There may even be "orphan" pages, which can be found in SERPs but not through any link on the website.Image credit: BacklinkoThe ideal site architecture uses a hierarchical URL structure that's intuitive and easy to navigate. Pages are grouped as subcategories of broader categories, with pages just a few clicks from one another. SEOs commonly refer to this hierarchical strategy as "siloing." Bruce Clay uses the analogy of a file cabinet to illustrate: "For the file cabinet to be effective, everything must remain tightly grouped in its place and filed under the appropriate structured heading. Every distinct category has its own heading." This means if you're an outreach software company, all of your email outreach pages would be grouped together, and all of your digital PR pages would be grouped together, plus any other use cases like content marketing, SEO, and link building would each be grouped together.Silos generally follow this format:https://www.example.com/category/subcategory/Image credit: BacklinkoConsider how Viral Loops organizes its pages under higher-level categories:Industry use caseshttps://www.viral-loops.com/industries/newslettershttps://www.viral-loops.com/industries/fintechhttps://www.viral-loops.com/industries/startupshttps://www.viral-loops.com/industries/ecommerceTopic cluster (hub)https://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch Topic cluster supporting pages	https://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch/marketing-planhttps://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch/plan-templateshttps://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch/strategy  https://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch/emailhttps://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch/press-releasehttps://www.viral-loops.com/product-launch/metrics Template use caseshttps://viral-loops.com/templates/startup-prelaunchhttps://viral-loops.com/templates/newsletter-referral-softwarehttps://viral-loops.com/templates/milestone-referralhttps://viral-loops.com/templates/sweepstakehttps://viral-loops.com/templates/shopifyYou should do the same for your site—create simple, vertical categories and subcategories to organize how your pages are laid out. The exact process for creating this structure depends on your content management system (CMS), whatever platform you use to create and manage your web content, like WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, etc. In WordPress, for example, Page Attributes in your web page's settings sidebar allows you to categorize a page by nesting it under a "parent." ‍One last point on URL structure: Siloing does NOT mean you shouldn't internally link between silos. When it is contextually relevant to link between topics, do it. It's convenient to think of topics as discrete folders, but there will inevitably be some horizontal overlap between vertical topics.2. Internal linking best practicesOnce your URL structure is mapped out, you need to plan your internal linking strategy—how and when pages link to one another.Unless you have a massive website with 1,000s of pages, there's no need to over-complicate things with fancy formulas or log file analysis. Stick to best practices:1. Use topic clusters‍As you learned earlier, a topic cluster is a hub or pillar page that overviews a high-level topic and introduces relevant subtopics and intents. This page then links out to more detailed resource pages about those subtopics from relevant subheadings. Finally, each resource page links back to the topic cluster. Topic cluster: Product Launch 101: Guide with Templates, Checklists & MoreResource pages:Product Launch Marketing PlanProduct Launch Plan TemplatesProduct Launch StrategyProduct Launch Checklist2. Link out from authoritative pages‍Assess the relative authority of the pages on your site based on the strength of their backlink profile. Link to your top URLs from these authoritative pages.For example, your homepage may likely be the most authoritative page on your site. Consider linking to your top blog posts, use case pages, and service pages from your homepage to pass along PageRank and relevance.3. Use keywords in internal link anchor text‍In Google's words, "the anchor text you use for a link should provide at least a basic idea of what the page linked to is about." In our words, try to include the target keyword within the anchor text, naturally. Don't keyword stuff, and don't use text that is off-topic or has no relation to the content of the page linked to.4. Mix up your anchor text‍1.) Don't use the exact anchor text more than once per page. 2.) Don't use the exact anchor text for two different pages. 3.) Do write text that "makes sense" or "sounds natural."  Use your intuition and mix it up. Use broad match variations, synonyms, and other longtail variations that help convey the target keyword's context or search intent. For example, if you were targeting the keyword [internal links], you might use:internal linksinternal links for seointernal linkinginternal linking seowhat are internal links5. Prioritize relevance over locationAdd links to the most relevant, useful place on your page. Remember, context is king. So if you have a section talking about the value of SEO, that's the best place to link to a blog post about SEO ROI. 6. Add internal links from old contentThis falls under the "content maintenance" category. It's easy to let old posts slip, so spend an hour or two a week going over old articles and updating them with fresh internal links to new content. Finally, there doesn't seem to be a consensus on the "optimal" number of internal links per page. Some SEOs recommend using no more than 100, while others are sticklers for relevance and recommend using links sparingly (a handful per page, linking to highly-relevant pages only). ‍Our recommendation: Instead of counting links, just add them where you think they’re most relevant and will provide value for users.7. Optimize and maintain your contentRecommended optimization tool: ClearscopeAt Demand Curve, Clearscope is the last stop before every new post goes live. ‍Clearscope is our preferred content optimization tool because it automates much of the work you'd otherwise have to do manually to get the most out of your content and rank.Clearscope takes the guesswork out of SERP analysis. It scrapes the top 30 search results and shows you relevant terms and keywords you should include in your content to rank. It also helps you outline and structure content to ensure you don't miss any pertinent search intents, subtopics, or citations.You can write your articles anywhere, including in Dropbox Paper, Google Docs, etc. But it’s worth writing your content directly in Clearscope—or at least pasting your article inside Clearscope before publishing it.That’s because Clearscope grades your content based on a few different parameters:Word count: Clearscope assesses other articles that use that keyword and provides a suggestion on ideal word count. Longer isn’t necessarily better. It depends on the keyword.Readability: Again, Clearscope assesses other related content and offers an ideal readability level. Harder—or easier—is not a given. Use the tool.Use of related keywords/terms: There are a number of terms that make sense to be included in the article, although the writer should not force this.There are several content optimization tools on the market, but Clearscope is our favorite—we use and love it. And Clearscope's quality-first approach to SEO matches our recommended strategy.Reminder: Demand Curve readers can test Clearscope by getting up to 3 complimentary reports. Head over here to get your free reports.Content pruning Content pruning is the process of deleting or merging content on your site that isn't providing value. A piece of content has no value if: It receives little trafficIt ranks for no keywordsIt has no valuable inbound links It's important to routinely "prune" content (once every few months) because removing low-value pages makes it easier for Google to find the important high-value pages on your website. It's counter-intuitive, but many SEOs experience significant increases in traffic after deleting low-value pages. Content pruning provides three main benefits:1. Improves the overall quality of your content. Pruning low-value pages improves your pages:clicks ratio, which makes Google more likely to value the quality of your content as a whole. Let's look at a hypothetical example:If 100 pages are pulling in 1,000 search clicks, the pages:clicks ratio is 1:10, meaning your next page should pull in 10 search clicks.Now, imagine 90 of those 100 pages have no value. After pruning them, the number of pages reduces to 10, but they still pull in 1,000 search clicks. The ratio is now 1:100, meaning your next page should get 100 search clicks. Google is more likely to favor a domain with 10 pages that get 100 search clicks each (high pages:clicks ratio) versus a domain with 100 pages that get only 10 clicks each (low pages:clicks ratio). 2. Optimizes distribution of link equity. The more low-value pages you have, the more link equity spreads through these weak pages, therefore diluting link equity to your higher-value pages. Pruning helps concentrate link equity distribution to your important pages.‍3. Website de-bloating and speed improvements. This isn't as big of an issue for sites with < 1,000 pages or so, but if you make your site easier to crawl, Googlebot will crawl it more often, so you'll be able to make progress faster.To figure out which pages to prune, perform a content audit.Content audit frameworkTo make a truly informed decision, you should aim to pull in as many metrics as possible. We recommend pulling the following data points as a starting point:Sessions (organic and total) Number of inbound linksPost date/last edited dateNumber of keywords ranking in the top 100, top 10, and top 3ImpressionsClick-through rate12-month traffic trendTo perform your audit, choose an option below that matches your SEO toolkit, then follow the steps.Option 1. Complete tool stack methodTools needed:Ahrefs subscription Screaming Frog subscriptionAccess to the website’s analytics and search consoleOpen the tools mentioned above, then follow Andy Chadwick's step-by-step tutorial and make a copy of this content pruning spreadsheet. According to Andy, the entire process should only take about 15 minutes.We recommend this option because it scales and does all the analysis for you in the spreadsheet—just pipe in your data from your tools. When you're done, the spreadsheet will recommend one of four actions for every URL you include in your data dump. Here are the four possible actions, along with their decision criteria:Action #1: Update contentURL has lots of keywords ranking in the top 100, but not necessarily the top 10 or top 3Content hasn't been updated in a whileSteadily declining trafficLots of impressions but low CTRLow word count (~500 or less)Action #2: Leave content as isContent was recently updated or published and hasn't had enough time/data for a decision yet.Content already performs well and the risk to updating outweighs the potential opportunity for reward.Action #3: Delete contentNo backlinksLow/no keywords ranking in the top 100Time specific content (old sales pages, expired promotions)Low predicted trafficLow word countAction #4: Redirect contentLow traffic but has backlinksLow number of keywords ranking overallTime specific contentLow predicted traffic‍Redirect tip: If you decide to redirect a URL, don't arbitrarily redirect to the home page. Instead, perform an advanced search operator for the page's topic (e.g., "site:hubspot.com content marketing") and link to the most topically-relevant page.Option 2. No Screaming Frog methodIf you don't have Screaming Frog or access to Google Analytics, we recommend Siege Media's resource as an alternative. It gives you detailed step-by-step instructions for two typical setups:No Screaming Frog (only GA access and Ahrefs)No Google Analytics access (Ahrefs only)Once you complete your content audit, make a decision to update your content, leave as is, delete, or redirect.Note: Before implementing any changes, manually check every page to make sure it does not have business value. For example, you may have paid landing pages that aren't getting organic search traffic, but drive conversions via paid traffic. Finally, when you're ready to start pruning, prune pages slowly, in batches (roughly 10% of total pages per batch). See how Google reacts after the first batch, then prune the next batch. Repeat this process until you're done.8. Track performanceAfter you optimize and publish your content, you will want to keep track of its performance over time. When something's working well, you want to do everything you can to ensure it stays that way.Here's what we'll cover: Keyword performance (rank tracking)Google Analytics (SEO aggregate, page-by-page performance)Google Search Console (search query performance for each page)1. Rank trackingThere are lots of different rank trackers on the market. But they all accomplish the same thing: show you how individual keywords rank over time. All you need to get started is a list of keywords and your domain URL. Rank trackers like Stat show you the ranking history for individual keywords so you can monitor content more effectively | Credit: ClearbitIf you notice a dip in performance or a competitor starts to outrank you, consider refreshing the piece, or updating it with new content.Ahrefs and SEMRush have rank tracking functionality in case you don't want to add another tool to your stack. Here's what Ahrefs' rank tracker looks like:2. Google AnalyticsSEO aggregateTo see how much organic search traffic your site is getting, log in to Google Analytics, navigate to Audience > Overview, and click "Organic Traffic" in the list of predefined segments.This report will show you how much of your website's traffic comes from organic traffic. Next, let's see how individual pages and blog posts perform.Page-by-page performanceTo find page comparison data, navigate to Behavior > Site Content > Landing Pages (make sure to keep the segment for “Organic Traffic”). Here we can see that the three most popular posts are about Instagram Stories, finding emails on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn influencers. They're bringing in about 50% of the total organic traffic.This tells us the articles are doing well, traffic-wise, but it doesn't tell us anything about which keywords they're ranking for or how those keywords are performing.3. Google Search ConsoleIn GSC, navigate to Performance and click the Pages tab down below to see real-time data around your top pages' key search metrics.Search performance by pageYou can also drill into an individual page to see what people are searching for to discover the page, along with impressions in the SERP, Clicks, CTR, and Position.Click on a URL and navigate back to “Queries.”This view shows you all the queries contributing to your page's performance. This is a good way to discover how people are finding your pages. You might find new keywords you hadn't thought of during your research. If that's the case, you can use this data to re-optimize pages for better performance.<- Previous ChapterNext Chapter ->Content-led SEO recapTo implement content-led SEO:Resolve major technical issues. Technical SEO helps Google access, understand, and serve your content. Run through this quick start guide and ensure your technical health is on point before proceeding.Generate keywords. Check GSC to see what keywords are already working for you. Then, generate a list of topically-relevant keywords and prioritize by intent and business value. Analyze the SERP. Analyze the SERP for hard and soft association patterns. Use these associations to inform what type of content you should create to rank (for B2B SaaS: product page, comparison page, article, or topic cluster).Write original SEO content. Fulfill SERP analysis requirements, enhance content with specificity, and include "originality nuggets" to stand apart.Create a premium content experience. Make content more user-friendly with elements like jump links, author bios, about pages, comfortable content structure, rich/original multimedia, and interactive content.Plan your internal linking strategy. A strong internal linking strategy distributes PageRank and topical relevance to the pages that matter most to your business. Plan a logical URL structure that supports crawl efficiency and site navigation, stick to linking best practices, and use natural and unbiased anchor text.Optimize and maintain content.

That's because people follow people, not brands.We'll build an organic audience that we'll later convert into customers. Much like we'd do on Twitter or YouTube.Why would we want to use LinkedIn for this?Because LinkedIn generates nearly 300% more B2B leads than Facebook:The platform has 660m active users.63m of them are in decision-making roles.If you're a B2B startup, you should have a presence on LinkedIn. It has much of the same virality potential as Facebook or YouTube, but with remarkably better B2B performance.A snapshot of the LinkedIn organic funnelWhy LinkedIn organic instead of LinkedIn ads?LinkedIn ads generally perform terribly.They work best for education, recruiting, and other career-related advertisers who generate $15k+ in revenue per customer.Other verticals often see unsustainable customer acquisition costs: LinkedIn ad clicks are expensive and the subsequent on-site conversion is poor.LinkedIn organic, however, has a surprisingly high ROI. Many marketers don’t realize that LinkedIn posts attract enough engagement to single-handedly drive top of funnel strategies.Today, LinkedIn remains a content deficient platform: there is more content demand than supply. Of all the major social channels, it remains easiest to become a top influencer on LinkedIn.The time that businesses spend investing in Twitter should likely be invested in LinkedIn instead.A bold statement, but the facts bear it out.Credit: Matthew Kobach‍What makes LinkedIn so special?The main advantage of LinkedIn is its "firmographic" data: business and employee information you can target by. No other social network has this level of specificity and consumption context.Further, LinkedIn is the primary platform people use to advance their careers. B2B companies that help with career development and recruiting see outsized success because they're getting in front of people who actually want to see their products.Case StudyTaylor Offer took advantage of LinkedIn's reach to build a following of over 50k people in 9 months. Now, he has over 100k followers.What this playbook coversThe LinkedIn strategy looks like this:Contribute meaningfully to LinkedIn's content pool.Acquire LinkedIn followers from posting that good content.Build trust with those followers.Get their email addresses.Email them to get off-platform conversion.Regardless of whether you're running a LinkedIn organic or paid strategy, your on-platform KPI is usually the same: capture email addresses.Why? In B2B marketing, it's hard to get an immediate purchase for high-consideration products. Especially those requiring the approval of multiple stakeholders.So, the strategy is to warm up leads, get their trust, incept them with the need for your product, then take things to a deeper conversation.The backbone of this approach is getting your audience to engage your LinkedIn posts. This distributes your content outside of your existing audience. Then, when new LinkedIn users see your content, some will follow you—and your audience growth flywheel begins.Accordingly, here's how this playbook is structured:Create a steady flow of leadsWriting posts that drive views, engagement, and conversionConversion systems to take leads off-platformHow to design a profile that increases your follow conversion rate1. Create a steady flow of leadsLet's cover how to connect with LinkedIn users. These folks will ideally share your LinkedIn posts so they reach new audiences who in turn follow you.Insight: Connect in clusters for greater viralityAlthough the key modality for securing audience engagement is being followed, connecting remains valuable because it's an action that you take.Whitelist the accounts that are most valuable to your business, and systematically connect to them. You'll be pairing this strategy with the inbound follower strategy.LinkedIn limits you to 30,000 connections, so be methodical about who you connect with. If you turn on a connections bot and let it rip, you'll reach that limit within the year.When deciding who to connect with, break down your audience into sub-audiences, which are clusters of people sharing the same job function within the same city. Then connect with one sub-audience at a time.For example, if you're selling your product to web developers, first connect to everyone who’s a Director of Engineering in San Francisco. Then move on to every Mobile Developer in San Francisco. When you're done with SF, move onto the next city.Why?When the LinkedIn algorithm detects post engagement concentrated from a cluster of similar people, it's likely to promote your post to more people just like them. (We've confirmed this strategy with LinkedIn team members.)If, instead, you have engagement all over the map and job spectrum, LinkedIn won't know who the ideal persona is to promote your content to.Insight: Avoid connection messages for greater acceptance ratesYou'll find guides all over the Internet suggesting you include a bespoke message when sending connection requests on LinkedIn.Consider avoiding that.Our data found that when everyone is loading connection requests with templated messages, requests without messages seem more real—and get accepted more.Neal O'Grady (via LinkedIn)Automating connections—will you be banned?To handle these connection requests, many marketers use bots.As a rule of thumb, it's best to only engage in natural behavior on LinkedIn. That minimizes the risk of being penalized by the algorithm.But our investigative research confirms that—at the time of this posting—LinkedIn's team isn't planning to ban accounts who use connection automation. Nor does it penalize an account's content visibility for the use of connection bots. (This could change in the future.)Why don't they punish this behavior? Ultimately, the broader each account's reach, the more engagement content gets—and that helps LinkedIn.Just don’t be egregious by over-using automation and behaving spammily. Connect with people most likely to want to connect with you.Third-party tool: Dux-SoupDux-Soup is a popular Chrome plugin that automates LinkedIn connecting. Alternatives we've heard good things about include Botdog, Phantom Buster, We-connect.Here's how to use Dux-Soup:Don’t exceed Dux-Soup’s default number of auto-connections per day. In fact, go 20% under (80 contacts a day instead of 100) to play it safe. This prevents LinkedIn from flagging aggressive automated activity and possibly sending you an account warning.Enter a search query for your target sub-audience into LinkedIn’s default search bar. Narrow your search using the prioritization framework we discussed earlier (by job title, location, etc).Click on Dux-Soup’s "Visit & Connect" button while viewing that page. It’ll crawl through the search results list and send connection requests one at a time—up to your daily limit.Dux-Soup integrates with your LinkedIn profile.Again, for optimal performance, start by not including a Connection message. A/B test one later if you'd like.Our take: you can leverage automation to double down on a channel where you already have an arbitrage opportunity—content deficient platform (more reach) x automation = high ROI.Get an initial burst of connectionsTo complement your sub-audience outreach, we recommend bootstrapping your initial connections by importing all the people you already know.The goal with jumpstarting connections is to unlock access to other LinkedIn members who are not yet in your network.LinkedIn blocks you from connecting with people who are multiple degrees removed from your personal network. The more connections you have to start, the larger your breadth of potential connections for automatic outreach.Export your company mailing list and your contacts out of Gmail. Put them in a spreadsheet.Bulk import them into LinkedIn.Click on the "My network" tab.Click "Connections" on the left rail.Click "More options" on the right rail.You'll have option to upload your spreadsheet file.Say “yes” to inviting non-matches.All those people will now get sent an email by LinkedIn suggesting they add you.LinkedIn also allows you to sync your email so that they periodically send notifications to new contacts from your email account.2. Post content that people engage withAs you're acquiring followers and connections, you should regularly post quality content.LinkedIn posts get a lot of exposureLinkedIn is a high-commitment channel that requires persistence. The most influential LinkedIn creators each dedicate 30+ minutes per day to it. This isn’t a second-tier consideration; your team needs to treat this like running a second blog.Since LinkedIn is a content deficient platform—more demand than supply—you get more reach than you do on other platforms.As a result, LinkedIn posts:Stay on feeds longer: The post visibility algorithm has a slow decay, meaning your content will linger in feeds for days. Top audience builders on LinkedIn report that posts build steam 48-96 hours after they're posted. And they can sustain continuous engagement for up to a month.Reach people far outside your immediate network—even if they don't go viral. When a person in your network comments on your post, it shows the post in their own audience's news feed.As a result, LinkedIn posts routinely get more views than they would on other platforms—assuming the same follower/connection count.For example, Neal's LinkedIn post below was viewed by almost 550,000 people. He only had 7,000 followers at the time. That's a massive advantage over other social media platforms that limit impressions to a portion of users who follow you.Neal O' Grady (via LinkedIn)We'll walk through engineer posts to get reach like this.The optimal posting strategyLinkedIn's news feed algorithm promotes people who:Frequently post high-engagement content.Spark conversations in the comments section and reply to people asking questions.Specifically, you want to build an audience that admires your insights and perspective, and also feels compelled to chime in.Your goal, therefore, is to have a steady stream of relevant insights injected into your posts.Ideas become insights when they hit the following criteria:Novel—is this idea new or is it at least a fresh take on an existing idea?Actionable—can my audience immediately act on the idea?High-leverage—when my audience acts on the idea, can it meaningfully change their work or their lives?Insights are rarely brand new, but they're recycled and repurposed from others. We suggest sourcing insights by:Consuming content from thought leaders in your area of expertise: sign up for newsletters, curate your social media feeds, and listen to valuable podcasts.Connect with the brightest minds in your field and consistently work through cutting-edge techniques and solutions to the largest problems impacting the field—for example, we chat with other top growth agency founders to trade learnings at least once a month.How to structure viral postsThis is the most important section of this playbook.We'll show you the types of posts that get you the most reach on LinkedIn. And then give you examples so you can replicate these for yourself.We identified these themes by interviewing top LinkedIn influencers, reverse engineering viral posts, and experimenting on our own LinkedIn accounts.Viral posts fall into two themesThere are two post themes that get traction on LinkedIn: industry-focused and human-focused.Industry-focused posts are insight-driven pieces of content that cement your position as a thought leader in your industry. This theme should be your priority.Credit: Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn)Compare that to human-focused posts, which are posts that do not relate to your industry. The goal of human-focused posts is to connect with your audience on an emotional level. This is achieved through storytelling and vulnerability.We see top influencers use human-focused posts for about one-third of their total post volume.Credit: Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)The combination of these two post themes is what builds a high-affinity audience: your posts provide industry insight and a relatable human touch.Post structureThere are three post structures that pair with the two post themes:Pure textResourcesStoriesWe'll break down each then we'll dive into examples.Pure textPure text posts include only text.We've found that it's best to stick to one or two-sentence paragraphs in your posts. Avoid long paragraphs at all costs.That's because about 60% of LinkedIn traffic comes through mobile, and short, punchy copy reads much better on mobile due to the small screen size. It also breaks up the copy and makes it more inviting to read.Here's how to make text posts work:Lead with a hook: LinkedIn truncates posts so that only your first two sentences show on the feed. After that, people need to click to read more. So it's critical to include a hook in your first two sentences that motivates readers to click.Add contextEnd with a zingerHooks generally follow the format of asking a tantalizing question or implying something controversial that isn’t fully revealed until they click "see more." Here are a few examples of hooks that work well:An unbelievable statistic or quoteA startling failure you experiencedStating that the status quo is wrongA self-evident description of a useful resource, e.g. "My favorite tools for creating landing pages are..."Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)After the hook comes the context. This sounds obvious, but many LinkedIn posts fail to catch on because they lack the context that properly sets up the zinger.Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)Then finish the post with a zinger—an insight bomb.The best zingers are elegant statements that leave the reader with something to think about. This is what gets people to hit the like and share buttons.Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn)Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)Resource postsResource posts follow the exact same structure as pure text, with one small difference. Instead of ending with a zinger, you attach a media asset to your post.It looks like this:HookContextAssetTwo examples include thematic image galleries (multiple images that show examples of a topic) and infographics/spreadsheets with useful data.Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn)Brian Balfour (via LinkedIn)The image asset is the insight—it's what provides a dopamine hit for your audience.Top LinkedIn users recommend using a thematic gallery when you're trying to show your audience useful examples—things that they can replicate. Think infographics and spreadsheets.Story posts—a human-focused approachAdding stories to you content mix is critical for virality.Why?They're human. It makes people build affinity toward you—to see you as more than a corporate stooge.Story posts also do something special: they build trust. When you tell vulnerable stories, you let people empathize with you. And believe in your authenticity.So how do you write a good story post? Try:A lesson you learned the hard wayA funny encounter you hadPoke fun at an ironic way people do thingsStories about challenging yourselfKatie Mitchell (via LinkedIn)Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)Final touches on your postsInsight: Connect with people who like your postWhen you make it a priority to continuously post quality content, you'll have LinkedIn users outside of your immediate network like and comment on your posts.Tip: send connection requests to all of these people. They're likely to accept your request since it's top of mind for them. They'll also feel valued since you took the time to notice their engagement and follow up by connecting.Ask for commentsAlways prompt readers to leave comments. Comments are the number one signal LinkedIn measures to boost your post’s public exposure beyond your existing audience. LinkedIn prioritizes content where conversations are happening.And, as a reminder, when a commenter comments, their followers will often see their comment. Through our research, we've found that getting comments can 4x your post's view count.Here are a few ways to ask followers for comments:“Leave a comment below if you recommend another resource.”“How often does this happen to you? Respond here and let me know.”“Do you have any stories like this of your own?”“What hacks do you use for accomplishing X?”When people comment, respond to further encourage conversation. Also tag popular people in your network to chime in, answer in-depth, and ask even more questions. The more conversations you have in the comments, the more reach you can see.Credit: LinkedInInsight: Should you include links in your post?We used to recommend that people avoid including links in your posts.Why?LinkedIn’s algorithm used to penalize you for sending people off of LinkedIn.But it has been reported (and widely discussed) that, in May 2020, LinkedIn made a change to the algorithm, and linking away from LinkedIn is no longer penalized.But it's important to remember that the algorithm favors content that gets lots of likes, comments, and shares. If you link off-platform, you run the risk of people clicking your link and not engaging with your content on LinkedIn. Their engagement modality shifts.While it's helpful to drive people to your own site, if your post fails to get likes, comments, and shares, it will reach fewer people.So link as you wish—so long as your posts are still designed to get strong engagement on the platform.Andrew Chen (via LinkedIn)Insight: When to postThe algorithm works against you if you don't post often.If you go 28 days without posting, you'll get so heavily demoted in the feed that your next post will only be seen by a small percentage of your connections.Further, posting at the right versus wrong time of day easily triples your reach.You want to post at times where most of your LinkedIn followers are active. This typically means around 8:30am in the time zone of the majority of your audience. We've tested this heavily.Complementary strategy: CommentingThe LinkedIn experts we interviewed recommend commenting on other influencers' posts. If their posts get millions of views and you have the top comment, you get many of those views too—which equates to more exposure and followers for you.Try to comment on 2-3 posts per day. That way people see your insightful comments all over the place—plus those LinkedIn influencers will be more likely to comment back on your posts, which shows your content in their audiences' feeds and drives up your views.Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)Commenting is also a way to test what to post: if one of your comments receives a lot of engagement, turn it into a full-fledged post of your own. Repurpose your work.3. Getting email addressesOk, let's take a step back.So far, we've covered:Connecting with sub-audiencesPosting content to get engagement and new followersOur goal on LinkedIn is getting a soft conversion—typically an email address. We add that email address to a drip campaign to eventually generate revenue.But it's not easy to take people off LinkedIn. This is where most LinkedIn funnels break.And that's by design—LinkedIn wants people to stay on-platform.When we spoke to LinkedIn audience builders, one shared that only 5% of his 100k+ followers are signed up for his newsletter.Methods of collecting emailsWe've identified two ways to capture emails from your LinkedIn audience.Send direct messages (DMs) to your audience members with a valuable free resource that requires their email address to see it.Build a system around capturing email addresses through your content.Gate your best insights so that readers need to provide an email address to see them.Occasionally link to landing pages to capture emails in exchange for resources like newsletters or one-pagers.1. DM strategyIf you already have valuable, free resources to entice connections with, sending direct messages offering that resource is an effective strategy. Require them to provide their email address in order to get the resource.They'll trust you if you've been posting insightful and human posts for a while. That's how this LinkedIn strategy ties together.In fact, the best way to get DM responses is to have first commented on your recipients' posts. This surfaces you on their radar and builds the expectation of reciprocity.Here are some examples of valuable free products to offer:Truly useful email newsletters—insightful, actionable newsletters that get people excited.Databases such as lists of recruiters, VC funds, and job opportunities.In-depth guides—long form educational content.If you don’t have an existing asset such as these, head to the "Capturing emails through your content" section.How to DM your connectionsThe DM conversation isn't where the end conversion happens. Users don't trust you enough to make a purchase just yet.So instead of following the scripted sales approach, provide genuine value.The goal is twofold:Get email addresses you can send drip emails to.Get them to trust your brand by seeing how valuable your resources are.This DM has worked well for us. It's human, it leads with value, and it's risk-free.Two examples of DM templates you can use:“Btw I put together a spreadsheet of the best VCs with their contact information. Since we went through YC we thought this would be helpful to founders looking for funding. We keep it gated and only share it with top founders. If you want to take a look just shoot me your work email and I'll get it to you.""Heads up that my team and I wrote a thorough playbook on landing page optimization. Happy to share with you if you think it'd be helpful. We keep it gated and only share it with top founders and marketers. If you want to take a look just shoot me your work email and I'll get it to you."Connections that receive this message get a relevant free resource and there are no strings attached. Why wouldn't they join?And just like that, we've got an email address.Is this a lot of work? Yes. But, on LinkedIn, you know you’re targeting all the firmographically-appropriate leads. You’re not spraying and praying. Everyone is worth something to you.Insight: Don't DM right awayTry waiting at least a month after connecting with folks so your audience has had time to digest your insightful posts before you reach out.2. Capturing emails within LinkedIn contentHere's the best approach we've identified for capturing emails directly from your posts:Regularly post insightful content without asking for anything—including emails.One out of every 5 posts, provide half of your content then require that they click a link and enter their email to get the other half.In other words, first build trust that your content is good. Then tease them with something that requires a small transaction.Build up from there.Nikhil Joshi (via LinkedIn)Nikhil Joshi (via LinkedIn)LinkedIn also offers onsite newsletters where you can embed CTAs to capture emails:Andrew Yu (via LinkedIn)Getting the purchaseNow that you have a steady flow of new leads’ email addresses, we’re officially moving beyond LinkedIn—the platform has done its job.This is the start of the final stage of your funnel—purchase conversion—where you’ll leverage email drips to sell to your leads.Drip campaigns are important enough to cover in an entire playbook, but here’s how we view final conversion in the context of your LinkedIn funnel:Since you’ve done the hard work of building affinity through your LinkedIn content, your leads should be excited to consume everything you create. A portion of your leads will be willing to pay for your products or services now that they know who you are, trust you, and view you as a thought leader.Well-done drip campaigns get those leads across the finish line.4. Optimizing your profile for followsThe best LinkedIn influencers are methodical about their profiles—it's not something to gloss over.It's the equivalent of the landing page on your website. You wouldn't ignore optimizing your page, would you?Change your CTAHere's the most critical change you can make on your profile:Change your "Connect" button to a "Follow" button.Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn). Note that the typical "Connect" button is replaced with a "Follow" button.Here's why:In our research, we learned that connections is an outdated feature. LinkedIn is prioritizing the follower model of engagement in their future roadmap. Their engineering team is actively building features for "audience builders"—the LinkedIn equivalent of influencers.There's still value in connecting with people as a source of lead generation—we already covered this—but connections require a lot of steps:Someone views your profile.They hit connect and add a note.You're required to go in, see the request, and accept it. Until all that happens, the user doesn't start seeing your posts.In comparison, when a user hits the "Follow" button, your content is immediately introduced to their news feed.Additionally, we know that LinkedIn limits you to 30,000 connections, but you can have an unlimited amount of followers.Here's how to change your profile action button:Go to your privacy settings (see the dropdown under "Me" then "Settings & Privacy"), click "Visibility" on the left panel, then "Visibility of your LinkedIn activity." Then click "Followers." You'll see the "Make follow primary" button. Switch it on.Profile basicsThe framework for optimizing the rest of your LinkedIn profile is simple: appear maximally useful to the persona you want to buy from you. That means:Write a bio header that highlights your social proof in your space. This is critical. This header is displayed on your outgoing connection requests to LinkedIn members. It's the description others use to judge whether they should accept.Include a concise "about" description that explains why you're worth following.Example: Julian ShapiroJulian founded Demand Curve, so his target audience includes entrepreneurs and marketers who are looking to advance their growth strategies.Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)In Julian's bio header, he features:YC S19 as social proof (he went through Y Combinator).TechCrunch Columnist signals transactional value.Investor signals that he's relevant to the entrepreneurs and marketers that come across his profile.Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)A concise description summarizes how he's valuable to his target audience: he grows and invests in startups.The Twitter link acts as social proof: anyone who checks out his Twitter sees that he has over 25,000 engaged followers.Example: Taylor OfferTaylor creates online courses and owns an apparel brand. His audience includes people who want to grow on social media and consumers of apparel.Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)"Best account to follow on LinkedIn" indicates that people will get value in following him: learn how to use LinkedIn better. (Note: It also encourages people to follow him instead of connecting with him.)"Forbes 30 under 30" and his media features add social proof.Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)Taylor's about description summarizes his value: he'll help you grow your LinkedIn audience through his academy.The rest of the description serves as social proof.That's all you need: a clear statement of value and effective social proof. If you get much wordier than that, people start skimming—and they overlook the URL you want them to visit.LinkedIn's new feature: storiesLinkedIn added a new feature on September 24th, 2020 called Stories. They're photos and videos that vanish 24 hours after posting. Sound familiar? It's a rip on Snap and Facebook (including Instagram).Credit: LinkedInBut here's why LinkedIn stories are worth testing:LinkedIn already struggles to get users to post to the feed. There's a chance that not enough users post to stories, either. This is another opportunity to take advantage of the fact that there is more demand for content than there is supply—more reach.Since stories just launched, LinkedIn will promote them heavily—its goal is to get users to engage with new features. If you consistently use stories early, you give yourself the opportunity to ride the wave of rising popularity. Some users will get a disproportionate share of story views.Stories give audiences a glimpse into the BTS of the professional world. Content creators can show audiences their day-to-day. It's relatable and can quickly build affinity.<- Previous ChapterNext Chapter ->Become a better marketer, in minutes.Join the Growth Newsletter.

You won't be allowed to post the same product again for six months—and that's only for total redesigns. You don't get redos.For this playbook, we interviewed 14 of the most successful hunters and makers. We cross-checked their advice and got to the bottom of hitting Product Hunt's front page.Why should you care about Product Hunt?Many household names got their start on Product Hunt: Robinhood, Gimlet, and Houseparty—to name a few.PH has proven itself to be the most effective place to launch and discover startups.Think of PH as Reddit for product launches, but with a kinder community.Makers or hunters post their products to Product Hunt.Members of the PH community upvote their favorites and leave comments.Products with a high quantity and quality of upvotes rise to the top and generate thousands of website visits.What we learned in our research is that there is a right way to do it. It's not the gamble that getting on TechCrunch or hitting the front page of Hacker News is.Let's explore the PH methodology we've uncovered.Topics we'll coverHow Product Hunt launches actually workLaunch myths bustedMost effective pre-launch strategiesHow to convert website visitors into customersHere’s where it gets interestingWhen you launch products on Product Hunt, you're reaching an audience that's actively looking for new and exciting products to try.That should make marketers' alarms go off.Early adopters get products off the ground. They’re essential for product validation, customer development, and momentum. Not only are they willing to use your product while you iron out the kinks—they actually enjoy it.Better yet, early adopters tend to share their opinions of new products with their networks. If they like yours, they'll become its first advocates.This is the true value of Product Hunt in the customer acquisition landscape: validation and early traction. Product Hunt isn’t a growth strategy. It’s not something you iterate on and try to make profitable and sustainable. Instead, it's a high-quality PR event that can help you grow a base of early adopters and build traction.If you want to build your own growth strategy and get customers consistently, then consider joining the Growth Program. Check out our free sample of the course that’s helped 1,000+ startups grow.What type of traffic can you expect?We’ve found that products that make it to the bottom of the front page can expect over 2,000 unique visitors on launch day. Products that hit the #1 spot can gain over 10,000 uniques.While these numbers aren't exceptional, remember that conversion rates tend to be strong because Product Hunt's audience members are innovation fanatics.Ten thousand site visits could turn into 1,000-3,000 genuine leads for your business. We'll expand on this point in the conversion goal section right below.Plus, when you hit the top five products of the day, you're featured in the next day's Product Hunt digest email.How Product Hunt launches actually workTo launch successfully on Product Hunt, your product needs to make it to the front page. To get there, it has to attract a lot of upvotes and engagement.Product Hunt is similar to Google search in that few people look past the first results. Audience attention is concentrated on the highest-ranking posts.But that doesn't mean you should fish for upvotes at any cost.Product Hunt doesn’t like it when marketers try to game the system.Their algorithm actively demotes posts that show clear signs of fishing for upvotes—e.g., when a product gets a large number of votes from newly created accounts. The Product Hunt team even monitors Twitter for PH vote fishing spam.But there’s nuance here: While Product Hunt doesn’t want you to blast the internet with upvote requests, they too need new users to grow.So if you’re authentically—and respectfully—hustling and asking your true social network for feedback on Product Hunt, it's unlikely that you'll be punished.We'll teach you lots of nitty-gritty aspects of PH in a minute, but here’s the short version of how you can get upvotes without being spammy:Prepare an existing seed audience in advance, and have them engage with you on Product Hunt on launch day. You should be doing most of the work before launch day.Build a positive reputation in startup communities in the weeks leading up to launch, and ask your advocates to support you on launch day.If you connect with a well-known hunter, ask them to hunt your product. You’ll be fast-tracked to the front page, and the added social proof may get you more votes from established Product Hunt members. We'll explain how to pull this off shortly.How to launch on Product HuntThe rules of pre-launch1. Don’t focus on upvotes. Set a real conversion goal.Upvotes are mostly a vanity metric. Keep your eye on the ball. What you want are email addresses and leads.While upvotes can propel your product to the top of the front page, what really matters is what you do with the traffic.In short, most SaaS, service, and ecommerce startups should optimize their Product Hunt launch for capturing emails.Here’s why:Product Hunt is a discovery channel. It's where people hear about you for the first time. As with most top-of-funnel channels, you're far more likely to capture email addresses than immediately get purchases or signups.To maximize ROI, let email capture guide every part of your Product Hunt strategy, instead of treating it like a second-tier goal.Set your KPI. We suggest a target of 1,000+ emails. That’s reasonable based on our experience—and it’s a large enough audience to begin validating your product.Update your website to optimize for email capture. That means making sure you have a clear CTA to capture emails. What super enticing asset or promise will you offer in exchange for an email?Set up an email campaign for these leads. Your email campaign is where the real, at-scale conversion happens. You must have this in place before launching on PH.The exceptions to this email-first strategy are free products like mobile apps and social networks. Product Hunt users love free consumer products that they can immediately get their hands on. Makers of these products should optimize for, say, free app downloads instead. You can collect emails later, during your onboarding flow.2. Don’t launch before you have a small followingThe biggest Product Hunt mistake is launching before your pre-launch audience is primed. The top hunters told us this over and over. Not enough people are listening when they warn about this.To have a successful launch, you need at least a small group of supporters who are willing to advocate for your product. This is because Product Hunt doesn't create momentum. It amplifies momentum.PH is not the channel you use to get your first set of users. It's the second channel you use—once you have that small starting set.We suggest an audience of at least 400 people before launching.3. The quality of engagement matters mostOn Product Hunt, the quality of upvotes is more important than the quantity of upvotes.Quality upvotes come from active PH-ers. They've been on the platform for months and engage regularly.Product Hunt's algorithm appears to favor products that get engagement from established PH members.This makes sense: Account longevity serves as a proxy for authenticity. Product Hunt doesn't want companies to compel their audiences to make accounts just to upvote their products.This is why you’ll see many products with a higher number of upvotes finish the day with a lower ranking than products with fewer upvotes.So here's the quality > quantity framework we've identified:Leverage your existing community members who are also PH users. Sincerely ask for their help.Make new connections with established PH users.Let's talk about that last point.There are startup communities adjacent to PH where you can engage, build your reputation, and carry that social capital over to your PH launch. People in these communities are almost always on Product Hunt too—because innovators gravitate toward PH.If you launch in adjacent communities and ask for feedback, people will become attached to your journey and voluntarily follow you over to PH.In short, this is a game of social psychology, not upvote hacking.Join some of these communities in the weeks before launch. Build up social capital by contributing, helping, and providing feedback on other people's projects.Some examples:If you’re an engineer, join engineering groups. Help solve others' problems. For instance, you could share a blog post that helped you remove a blocker in your own work.If you’re a marketer, join marketing groups. Contribute findings from different growth experiments you’ve run.Here are some communities to consider:Indie HackersStartup SchoolThere are also Slack and Facebook groups where makers announce their Product Hunt launches and exchange feedback.Slack groups:product-school.slack.comstartupstudygroup.slack.comlaunch-chat.slack.comGrowthhackertalk.slack.comFB groups:www.facebook.com/groups/producthuntupvoterswww.facebook.com/groups/producthunt.exchangeThe best communities to join are the ones where you can add the most value. The more value you add, the more likely people will be to reciprocate on PH and elsewhere.Here's the critical takeaway that should permeate your larger growth strategy: Community engagement should be an ongoing activity for your marketing team. The benefits of building on-the-ground relationships outlast PH. Always invest some percentage of your marketing time into adding value to thriving communities.4. Get a Product Hunt insider to hunt your product“Hunting” is Product Hunt–speak for posting your product.Let’s bust a myth:In the past, it was important to have a reputable Product Hunt member hunt your product. That’s because Product Hunt used to send an email to that hunter's followers when they hunted. So the larger a hunter's follower base, the more awareness a product got.Product Hunt no longer sends those email notifications.Instead, they're on record suggesting that you hunt your own product. They say it’s easier, and you’ll save the time you’d spend convincing a popular hunter to post on your behalf.However, that isn't the whole truth. It turns out that your product can, in fact, get a huge boost when it's hunted by popular hunters.It's not critical that you make this happen, but it's worth the attempt.Specifically:Every day, hundreds of products are submitted, but only a select few are featured on the homepage. We've confirmed that when a super popular hunter hunts your product, it will automatically jump to the front page. That’s a massive advantage. These "superusers," as PH calls them, can choose to feature one product per day.Attention from a well-known hunter confers social proof. When a superuser hunts your product, your launch gains credibility. You’re more likely to get upvotes, comments, and even emails from community members.A well-known hunter who's connected to other power users will also get you more quality upvotes, which can compound your rise through the rankings.If you’re not already connected to a superuser, browse Upvote Bell's leaderboard, which ranks top hunters. We've personally had great experiences with Chris Messina and Hiten Shah.If you can't get a superuser to post, don’t sweat it. You can absolutely hunt your own post. At the end of the day, if you have a great product and pre-launch momentum, you'll get enough engagement. Just lean harder into your pre-launch audience building and engagement.5. Time your emailsProduct Hunt launches are a game of timing.Blast all your channels at once—and do it first thing in the morning. You want to climb to the top of the daily rankings fast, then spread out the remainder of your votes evenly throughout the day to maintain your "vote velocity." This will keep your product ranked highly.Here’s what we suggest for email in particular:Three to four weeks in advance, send an email to your list explaining the value Product Hunt will have for your launch. Help recipients understand how important it is to you. Ask them to create an account and engage with PH. Only a small percentage of the people on your list will. That's normal. But those who do will become invested in your launch and success.Schedule a follow-up email to trigger three days after your first. Ask recipients to spend two minutes upvoting and commenting on a few products on PH. While this is a big ask, it can have a significant impact on launch day. The Product Hunt algorithm favors votes from “warmed up” accounts.Prepare an email for launch day. Ask your list for feedback—not upvotes. If discovered by Product Hunt, requests for upvotes can result in a demotion of your product. Schedule the email to go out in batches throughout the day. To fight post decay and sustain velocity, you want to spread out your engagement over the course of the day.6. Choose your launch timeThe Product Hunt homepage is based on a 24-hour cycle. New posts hit the homepage at 12am PST each night, and more are added throughout the day.When scheduling your post, set the time zone to PST (not your own). Product Hunt doesn't adjust for different time zones.There are two considerations for timing: day of the week and time of day.Day of the week:We’ve found that it’s best to post between Tuesday and Thursday. Why not Mondays or Fridays? Mondays are often for catching up on work, and many people tune out by Friday as the weekend approaches.Time of day:To maximize how long your product appears on Product Hunt on the day you submit, post as early as possible in the day. You want your post to be seen by PHers across many time zones. If you schedule a post for just after midnight PST, you'll gain exposure across the entire 24-hour PH cycle.7. Make sure you post's content is optimizedYour post consists of a product description, images, and a few other assets.The steps you need to complete before posting:Sign up for a personal account—no branded or business accounts.Don’t use emojis or descriptions in the title. Just use the name of your product. Product Hunt users will want to easily identify your product, and you can help them remember it by keeping your title clean.Make your product name the title. It's clean and easy to remember.For the thumbnail, Product Hunt recommends 240x240 pixels. We suggest using an image that grabs attention, such as an animated GIF; your standard logo will also work. Don't make GIFs too distracting. Otherwise, your logo will perform better.Showcase your product's value. Type Studio is a video editor, so their thumbnail has motion.Highlight the product in action. Trace by Sticker Mule removes backgrounds from images. They show their product in the GIF.Remote | Workers emphasizes their value prop with their GIF: Work anywhere and get hired by good companies.Sometimes your recognizable logo is all it takes to get top product of the month. Don't overthink it.‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍Another suggestion: Add an engaging video or animated GIF to your media gallery. The recommended size for gallery images is 635x380. Make sure the first asset in your gallery is your best—Product Hunt will use it in your post as the meta image for social sharing.Two types of assets work best:Video demonstrations showing a product's capabilitiesA product walk-through by the maker8. Write your maker commentYour "maker comment" is your opportunity to introduce yourself, your team, and the product you created to the PH community. It will appear right below your product gallery. It's highly visible.Use your comment to add a human touch to your post and connect with your audience, so they build affinity with you as the maker—and not just your product.Highlight your key value proposition and the problem you solve. We’ve found that the more helpful and humble—and less promotional and fluffy—a maker's comment, the more comments it's likely to get.Dru calls out that he's nervous about launching on Product Hunt. It's honest and relatable.This maker comment is helpful because it's broken down into three sections: problem, solution, and monetization. The problem explains the "why," the solution explains the "how," and the monetization section gives specifics about the business model.If you're looking to go above and beyond to capture engagement, consider creating a landing page specifically for PH users. You can include your page as the primary link and add a special offer for the community. Here are two of our favorite examples:ThatdayRosali TeaOne last thing on posting: Sanity-check the appearance of your post before you go live. Make sure the content is inspiring enough that it would motivate you to click it yourself.We recommend doing this with Preview Hunt, a tool to preview your PH post.Product Hunt launch recapSet an email conversion goal. Don’t get distracted by upvotes.Hold off on your launch until you build up an audience of at least 400 people. Preferably more.Add value to startup communities to build social capital before your launch. This can be converted into quality upvotes and engagement on launch day.Prepare your emails (and any corresponding social media posts) in advance.Try to find a reputable hunter, and ask them to hunt your product. Make sure you pass off all your assets to them well in advance of your launch day.Schedule your launch for a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning—at 12am PST.Preview your post in advance. If you wouldn't click it, neither will anyone else.<- Previous ChapterNext Chapter ->Become a better marketer, in minutes.Join the Growth Newsletter.

You'd be empowering an army of trusted people who introduce your brand and products to excited potential customers.That’s influencer marketing, and that’s what we’re going to reverse engineer at a more advanced level than you’ve seen before.On average, every $1 spent on influencer marketing results in ~$6 of revenue—a 600% ROI. And by working with influencers, some SaaS and ecommerce companies are consistently acquiring high–lifetime value (LTV) customers at $5 each. That’s almost unheard of with paid acquisition. Especially in a world where Instagram ads have CACs that rarely dip below $20. Influencer marketing can be a more profitable and scalable acquisition channel than paid ads.We’ve interviewed 10 top influencer marketing practitioners for this playbook—marketers who have actually scaled influencers as a growth channel—so you can get everything you need to test influencer marketing immediately. We'll cover tactics that the best companies are doing but not talking about openly.You’ll learn:How to find and activate influencers who can actually sellHow to automate your influencer process, so you get more with far less workTactics to optimize top influencer channels: Instagram, YouTube, and TikTokHow to accurately attribute purchases from influencer marketingContext on influencer marketingIf you’re advanced in influencer marketing, click here to skip the introductory context and begin with advanced strategy.What is influencer marketing?Influencer marketing is a collaboration between a business and an influential person to promote something—typically a product, service, or campaign.“Influencer” can describe anyone from a celebrity actor or professional athlete to everyday folks who have a few thousand followers on Instagram. The thing they all have in common: They create content that their audiences pay attention to.Influencer marketing typically looks like this:Businesses find and reach out to relevant influencers.Influencers create content to promote products and services to their audiences.Businesses compensate them in exchange for exposure and creative assets.Reasons to consider influencer marketing:Conversion: Create an affiliate engine by arming a community of influencers with performance-based compensation.Grow your organic social following: Some influencers’ followers will follow your company account. Then you’ll be able to reach them “for free” with organic posts.Social proof: Influencers’ audiences see your collaboration as a stamp of approval for your brand.Get content: Influencers can create content for you. And you can use that content for your own ads, organic social posts, and landing pages.Goals of influencer marketingTo figure out where you should be focusing your influencer efforts, think about what you want to get out of your campaigns:Are you looking for a high return on ad spend (ROAS)?Are you building a community? Are you prioritizing impressions and awareness?Are you simply interested in contracting out the production of quality content?A few examples of how companies use influencer marketing:HVMN works with fitness and nutrition influencers on YouTube to reach audiences who regularly purchase supplements. Their main focus is increasing ROAS.Athletic Brewing, a non-alcoholic beer company, works with sports and outdoor influencers whose Instagram audiences are looking for healthy alternatives to alcoholic beer. They focus on building community and brand awareness.Apparel brand Moncler collaborated with fashion influencers and created a song for TikTok. It went viral and reached millions of users interested in fashion. The goal of their campaign was to generate impressions and awareness.The Hustle worked with tech Twitter influencers to get signups for their business and tech-leaning newsletter. They were focused on conversion and increasing ROAS.Which companies should use it?Influencer marketing works exceptionally well for consumer companies that sell broadly appealing products. This lets brands test the effectiveness of many different niches and influencers, then narrow down to those with the best results—which is often needed to make campaigns profitable.Take Ridge wallets. Their products are broadly appealing (they sell wallets), so they’re able to sponsor gamers, car enthusiasts, travelers, and athletes. They have enough surface area to hunt for the best influencer arrangements.Or Honey, the automatic online coupon tool. Since everyone who shops online benefits from saving money, they can work with influencers across every niche.Data from influencer platforms supports this claim. Our platform of choice is Modash—they have some of the best influencer marketing data, which brands use to run hyper-targeted campaigns. Modash’s data shows that the best results come in broad product categories like blankets, food delivery, hair care, and ride hailing.Among broadly appealing products, these types of brands typically see the best results:1. Brands that sell physical products directly to consumers (DTC): Physical products show well through social media’s video and photo content.Good: Well-designed protein shakes are likely to show well through photos and video. They’re portable, so influencers can create an array of appealing content—they might take photos and video at the gym or beach.Bad: Email marketing software. It’s more challenging for influencers to capture the magic of digital products through photos and video.2. Brands with perceived high-quality products: If influencers truly love your products—so much that they’d want to pay for them—you can “gift” them product in exchange for content and exposure. High-quality products also create strong word of mouth that amplifies the return on influencer campaigns.Good: An athletic-wear brand that makes their products with ridiculously comfortable and durable fabrics. When influencers receive gear they're actually attracted to, they’re more likely to become brand evangelists.Bad: A brand that’s dropshipping stock T-shirts with custom prints. The low-quality products will dissuade influencers from sharing.But more generally, it can work for most B2C companies. (For niche B2B, it’s doable but more challenging, since there are fewer influencers with audiences that aggregate your desired buyers. For B2B, Twitter influencers, LinkedIn influencers, and podcasts can work better than influencers on other platforms.)Influencer marketing is evolvingWhile we’ll use the term “influencer” throughout this playbook, it’s important to note that the people you’ll want to work with are beginning to prefer the term “creators.” Creators place more artistic value on the content they create than legacy social media celebrities do. They’re writers, photographers, videographers, artists, and performers. They’re craftspeople. A second change has gone hand in hand with the creator movement: Influencer marketing has become increasingly performance-driven. Brands are moving away from paying lump sums for creator posts, instead favoring payment models that compensate creators based on how many conversions they drive. This is a better deal for brands.There are a number of platforms that make it easy to track influencer-derived conversions (e.g., Bitly, Shopify, and Tapfiliate)—so you’re paying for conversion, not simply reach.The old approach to influencer marketing is simply not as profitable. It entails:Paying large sums based on follower countsDictating to influencers how you want them to post their content—as if you know their audience better than they doAffiliate marketing (paying influencers for sales that come in through unique links) and whitelisting (running ads through creator accounts) are two of the new performance-based influencer marketing models that have grown in popularity. We’ll cover both.There are, however, also downsides to a performance-based approach:It’s not easy to find influencers who agree to this model: Big influencers are used to getting paid upfront for their content.You could become too focused on ROAS: Many brands fail to track ROAS effectively. Then they shut down their influencer marketing, even though they’re getting a lot out of it, both on the performance side and brand side.How to 80/20: Starting with influencer marketingHere’s the 80/20 influencer marketing approach we recommend starting with:Begin with Instagram: It’s the ideal test channel.Set aside 15 hours per week: This is necessary to properly test the channel. It takes serious work to validate.Get good data: We’ll show you how to get data on which influencers are worth working with.Start with brand ambassadors: Pay these influencers via an affiliate model and form long-term relationships with them.Optimize your processes: Now that it works, reduce your time investment to make influencer marketing more scalable and easier to delegate.Optimize the economics: Run tests to increase your ROAS.Nurture relationships: Empower your influencers for better results and more brand credibility.Let’s look at each step in detail.Start with InstagramMost influencer marketers should consider starting with Instagram. Here’s why:Instagram influencer marketing is already validated across most verticals and business models.How the channel works is widely understood. It’s likely that each member of your team has an Instagram account where they're at least occasionally active. Most influencer marketing tools are already built around Instagram. You can leverage Facebook’s infrastructure. Increase the impact of your campaigns by using Facebook's Brand Collabs Manager, shoppable posts, and Ads Manager.We’ll explore other channels later. For now, it’s important to focus. Your goal isn’t to “do influencer marketing.” Your goal is to build a process around a scalable, affordable acquisition channel.Set aside 15 hours per week at minimumBuilding an influencer marketing funnel is time-consuming. It involves:Finding and assessing influencers at scaleCommunicating with and onboarding influencersManaging long-term relationshipsDeciding on incentive structures and payoutsSetting goals and measuring successAutomating to reduce cost per acquisition (CPA)Running experiments to improve performanceEach of these steps requires serious optimization—not just setup. For example, in your initial outreach to influencers, you have at least three variables to experiment with:What do you say in your first messages to build trust and excitement?Where do you say it? (E.g., comments, DMs, email, Story responses, etc.)What sequence do you say it in? (DM then comment? Comment then DM? How many email follow-ups?)We’ll cover each of these.1. Finding influencersLet’s begin.First, know that most brands that have poor experiences with influencer marketing make a big mistake: They don’t actually find influencers with audience-product fit. You’d be surprised by how many brands pay influencers who look “on brand,” without realizing that the influencer’s audience is completely different from their own consumers.You must get their audience data from them before agreeing to a partnership. Some notable data points to request:Geography—preferably broken down by country, then state, then cityDetailed age breakdownGender breakdownTopics of interest based on engagement with the influencer’s contentConversely, don’t overly narrow your target audience. If you sell lamps, your target persona isn’t someone who's interested in lamps. Go one level higher to target people who are interested in interior design, architecture, or even fashion.Good: Our audience is 22-30-year-old women in New York City, interested in hobbies related to design, architecture, real estate, or fashion.Bad: Our audience is precisely 22-year-old women in the United States who feverishly scroll Instagram looking for lamps.You’ll eventually use SaaS tools to find relevant influencers, rather than patrolling Instagram manually. Our favorites are Modash (known for its influencer data), CreatorIQ, Dovetale, and Influent.But starting your hunt manually is beneficial. Getting into the weeds helps you understand your market and its players. What do they talk about? What do they post?Here are a few ways to start manually:Look at relevant, high-performing brands: Look at adjacent brands on your preferred channel that are getting a lot of positive engagement. Find influencers who are tagging them by navigating to the “Tagged” sections of their profiles.Look at hashtags: Search for hashtags related to promotions, like #sponsored, #paid, or #ad. Then search for hashtags in your niche, to ensure that you’re only sorting through influencers who are relevant to your brand. By searching by hashtag, you can narrow your search to the active influencers who are most likely to reach your audience.Crawl your audience manually: Look through DMs. Figure out which influencers are already tagging you.Once you find a fit, ask for intros: Ask your first influencer for their suggestions of who else to work with. You can also use Instagram's “similar profiles” functionality to find others who might be a fit. Once you get a lay of the land, it’s critical to switch to one of the tools we mentioned above. They'll help you power your influencer selection and audience measurement.When assessing influencers, there are two considerations to keep in mind: engagement and ambassadors.Consideration: Check for engagementBefore reaching out to the influencers who appear relevant, ensure that they have a high-quality and real audience. Some influencers purchase followers to inflate their asking price. That’s why we rank influencers based on engagement. That said, engagement can also be purchased for as little as $0.0088 per like, but using a fake follower tool can help. Tools can run analytics on profiles and filter out the ones that raise red flags—like profiles without profile photos, followers, and feed content.Real comments are easy to spot. Check out this example from Blue Apron. You’ll notice that people are commenting on both the recipe and the dog—signaling that they’re actually consuming the content in the post.‍Fake engagement, on the other hand, looks more like this:Just emojisVague comments like “love it” and “keep it up”No substantial comments or questionsCredit: https://shanebarker.com‍If you’re scaling up and using an influencer discovery/analysis tool, it should include an engagement-rate calculator and a follower-credibility checker (like Modash’s fake follower tool).If you’re not using a SaaS tool, here’s how you can vet your list manually:Look at each influencer’s engagement (likes and positive comments). Make sure they look authentic. There should be comments that show genuine interest in the product or ask specific questions—not only generic comments like “Nice! 🔥” You can also scroll through the commenters and look for suspicious profiles (i.e., ones without profile images).Do your due diligence on audience fit. Most social platforms have audience insight tools with data about location, age, and interests. Ask influencers for screenshots of their engagement and audience stats. Consideration: Start with ambassadorsYou’ll notice that we use the term "ambassadors" throughout this guide. Ambassadors are long-term influencer partners who operate on an affiliate model.Why use an affiliate model? Instead of getting paid to post, some influencers will let you pay them to convert others. This de-risks your spend and sets you up to potentially work with them long term, instead of for the duration of one campaign. Here’s what happens when brands work with influencers long term:High frequency: Your product is continually surfaced to that influencer’s audience. Audiences often only consider buying products after they’ve seen them multiple times. Trust: When audiences see influencers acting as brand representatives over a long period of time, they’re more likely to trust the brand and its products—because it no longer looks like a one-off sponsorship. People internalize the fact that the influencer probably believes in the brand. More trust leads to better results.Data: One-off campaigns don't provide enough insights into what type of content or influencers work best for your brand. By developing ongoing relationships, you can run experiments and guide influencers to be more efficient (by sharing what's working).As a result, content from durable relationships drives higher engagement and, typically, higher conversion rates.2. Optimize your influencer workflowLet’s optimize three steps of your relationships with influencers.Step 1: Look at your internal data Segment your existing customer data to dial in to your highest-earning personas. Say, for example, that your brand sells outdoor backpacks. You would analyze your data to understand the psychographic traits of your highest-LTV customers—those who spend the most over a period of time. Then you would find influencers whose audiences align with your highest-LTV customers. You could match influencer audience data with your own internal data to optimize the influencers you work with.Once you’re working with a number of influencers, you can pull their data into a dashboard using a data visualization tool like Looker. Compare their audience data with their impression and conversion numbers.Double down on your top performers, seek out new influencers who have similar audiences to them, and drop the underperformers.Step 2: First contact and onboardingTo help them figure out how the program works, you can build a landing page for influencers. Include:Benefits of joiningRequirements (like minimal follower count)CTAs to collect their informationBonus: social proof to increase conversionThink of influencer recruitment as a funnel: If influencers clearly understand that you run a fun, trustworthy, lucrative program, you’ll recruit more—and higher-quality—influencers. You attract the best of the best not just by paying them, but also by effectively pitching them on why they should associate their identities with your brand. Don’t rely on a short DM to do this. Build out a landing page.Here’s an example of a strong partner landing page from Athletic Greens.Here’s another example, from Four Sigmatic.On to outreach.We recommend recruiting your first 20-30 influencers manually before automating first-touch outreach. By reaching out manually to your first batch of influencers, you’ll learn what gets them excited and what establishes trust. You’ll also find friction points that you can smooth over before scaling outreach or delegating it.Maybe your language isn’t casual enough for the type of influencers you’re trying to reach, so you’re not getting responses.Or maybe your offer isn’t compelling enough, and you need to increase your affiliate payout.Aim to get a response from at least 50% of the creators you reach out to. According to our partners’ data, that’s a sign that you’ve found outreach-influencer fit, and you can begin scaling up. Where should you send your message?If you try reaching out on influencer channels (like Instagram), the odds of your message getting lost in a crowded inbox are high.We recommend reaching out through a sequence of channel DMs, email, and comments on influencers' social posts.Start by sending an influencer a DM on Instagram. Follow up again after two days if you haven’t heard back.Simultaneously, find their email (usually easy through their Instagram profile or personal website). Send them an email, and mention that you also DMed them.If you don't hear back within a week, consider commenting on their Instagram posts. Since influencers often check and respond to comments to interact with their audience members, they’ll likely see your comment.Step 3: Incentive structuresOnce they’ve said yes, start experimenting with incentives that sustain you as a top priority for them. Treat nothing as static—everything is a learning opportunity for you and them. A few examples: Run a one-month promotion, with creators getting paid very well per conversion—say a 25%+ commission. Then, when you have enough influencer volume, segment creators to run your promo at different commission levels and find the “sweet spot” that's best for your brand’s economics.Give big cash bonuses at notable milestones. For example, send $10,000 after the first 50, 100, and 1,000 conversions an influencer generates. Give a random creator in your network a PR boost each month. Highlight them on your blog, influencer page, newsletter, and social media channels. They’ll appreciate the boost, and they might be more likely to push your product organically, without you needing to enter into a contract.You should always require a minimum number of monthly conversions to stay in your influencer program. Continually increase that monthly conversion quota to keep influencers posting at a regular interval—and keep you from having to manage dead relationships with low ROI. 3. Optimize the channelNow that you have real and relevant influencers with working incentives, you can begin optimizing the channel itself (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.).There are two ways to focus your channel optimization: Increase the volume of acquisitions without increasing the number of influencersDecrease the cost per acquisition without paying less (increasing ROAS)Here’s the highest-leverage way to optimize your channel: Regularly share what’s working with your creators. Keep an eye out for when an influencer has a spike in conversions. See if you can identify why their content did particularly well, and reverse engineer it. Influencer monitoring tools can help you collect your content and understand what’s working more quickly. Share your findings with the rest of your influencers so they, too, can increase conversions. This is critical. Influencer marketing isn’t like running ads—influencers are people who need feedback loops and ongoing management.You further benefit from this being a two-way relationship in that, with their permission, you can repurpose the content your influencers create—you can post the same photos or videos they share on their own channels.Creating quality content is expensive and time consuming. By repurposing your influencers’ authentic content, you’re stretching out the benefit of your influencer marketing spend. Take a look at this post by Athletic Brewing. It’s the same photo we used in the example in our introduction—but this time, Athletic Brewing used it on their own feed:4. Invest in your relationshipsTo repeat, there’s a key distinction between influencer marketing and other growth channels: You’re working with humans, not dashboards.How to develop win-win relationships with your influencers:Become friends with them. Use casual language. Speak to them like a friend, not like a PR mouthpiece. Respond quickly, and avoid canned responses. Influencers don't like talking to robots or responding to scripted messages.Let them try your product first. They need to trust your brand and product before they recommend either to their audience. They'll be more authentic when they actually like and respect your brand and the people behind it. Get them excited. Influencers do their best work when they’re enthusiastic. Work with your influencers to understand what's been successful for them in the past and what gets their own audience excited.Set clear expectations. What are your timelines, goals, and requirements? If you make them clear early on, you’ll gain trust from your influencers, and they’ll be more likely to engage for the long term. There are a lot of fake, flaky sponsors out there wasting influencers' time.Limit admin work when possible. A 15-page NDA for a $100 Story post kills momentum. Save time and keep things moving by cutting out as much admin work as possible—especially for low-cost campaigns. If you’re arranging a longer-term contract or an expensive campaign, then some paperwork will be necessary. But keep it light.Invest more deeply in existing relationships. When your influencers post about you, thank them, and let them know what you liked about their post. Send them more products for free. Start a conversation about how you can continue working together. It’s often higher ROI to double down on existing quality relationships than it is to find and activate new ones. Most importantly: Give away creative controlRemember that influencers will be speaking directly to their audiences, so give them creative liberty. Why?Your content needs to be authentic.They know their audience best. They know what goes viral and what gets engagement. Meaning, provide guidelines rather than word-for-word scripts. Explain your goal and constraints. Share examples of content that has been successful for you in the past.But let them create the content.Only work with influencers whose visions align with yours. Study their content. That way, you know you can trust them to create strong original content.YouTube and TikTokFor many, only once you’ve proven success with Instagram should you move on to other platforms based on your learnings. Instagram is a clear first step because it’s familiar to most marketers, and most influencer platforms are set up specifically for it.Content looks different across channels, and influencers operate differently on each channel. So there's a lot of work that goes into building out any given channel.We’ll briefly cover the rest of the top three: YouTube and TikTok.Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are the top three channels for two reasons:They all have sizable, targetable audiences.They lend themselves to photos and video, which are usually necessary to drive conversion through influencers.The following platforms could also work for influencer marketing, but they don't typically work as well. Consider experimenting with them if your product lends itself to the platform:TwitterPinterestBlogsLinkedInTwitchYouTube influencer marketingPros of YouTube: Often better attribution: Links are listed directly in video descriptions, whereas with Instagram, users have to navigate to an influencer’s profile to click the link (adding friction).Videos are evergreen and searchable: Since videos are searchable, old videos stay relevant—unlike Instagram, where content dies quickly. High-quality older videos can generate 30-60% of revenue for YouTube influencer campaigns. You can see long-tail success.Long-form content builds trust: The longer-form video format allows consumers to understand a product better than they would if they were to come across it on platforms like Instagram or TikTok.Cons: High production costs: It’s expensive and time consuming for influencers to create video content. So it’s likely that YouTube influencers won’t work with you strictly on an affiliate basis—they’ll want to be compensated for the content they create.There are two types of influencer sponsorships on YouTube:Dedicated video: Pay for a custom influencer-created video featuring your brand.Mid- or end-placement: Pay for a placement either in the middle or at the end of an influencer’s main videos. This type of sponsorship can keep your costs down significantly because influencers aren’t creating dedicated videos for your brand.Examples of dedicated videos:Next Games partnered with YouTubers Lele Pons and Anwar Jibawi to advertise the release of their new Walking Dead mobile game. Pons and Anwar created a dedicated video for Next Games that raked in over 13 million views.Castrol Edge partnered with tech YouTuber Austin Evans for a dedicated video review of Castrol’s VR product.Example of mid- or end-placements:Yes Theory’s YouTube channel features Morning Brew at the end of one of their original videos:Ali Abdaal features Audible in the middle of one of his videos:Things to keep in mind when running YouTube influencer campaigns:Find influencers via search‍Look for YouTubers who have videos ranking for your products. They typically have Amazon affiliate links in their bios. You could onboard them into an affiliate program, so customers purchase directly from you instead of through Amazon.Create tests for longer-term relationshipsBecause it's more time-consuming to produce quality content for YouTube, there’s a higher barrier to entry for influencers. Compared to Instagram, there are fewer nano-influencers who are willing to accept affiliate pay for quick videos. So working with influencers on YouTube generally requires more cash upfront.But similarly to other channels, you can get more attractive influencer rates when you offer longer-term deals for multiple videos per month. It costs influencers less to create a few videos in one sitting for your brand, and they’ll pass those savings on to you.So consider creating “tests” for long-term, higher-ROAS arrangements:Find an influencer you’d like to work with. Pay them to shoot a single video.If you're happy with the results, offer a one-month test project: a 30-day opt-out contract for a set number of videos, based on clear ROAS targets.If they hit their ROAS targets, negotiate a 12-month contract that gives them extra compensation when they re-hit those targets. By offering a 12-month contract—which means steady income for the influencer—you're likely to get a better price.Make sure you and the influencer agree that the rights to the content remain with your brand. That way, you can use the content for ads, landing pages, or organic social down the road. This gives you more mileage and helps de-risk the campaign’s cost.Another reason for running long-term campaigns is that YouTube video performance is often volatile for influencers. For one video with an influencer, you could make $15k. For the next, it might be $1k. To guard against this, consider paying extra for performance—if the influencer will allow it. Use coupon codes and trackable links to help with attribution. Put these links and codes in the video description, and have the influencer pin a comment to the top of the comments section that re-shares them. For added redundancy, use a post-purchase survey to ask customers where they heard about you. TikTokTikTok is experiencing explosive growth for influencer marketing.Why?Attention spans for long form are losing ground to short-form memes.Production challenges favor short, on-brand, authentic video content.TikTok leans into this pattern with brief, engaging video content. It’s more approachable to create content here than polished videos on YouTube.Types of influencer content that work best on TikTok:Before and after videos. Guess paid for a video with a TikTok couple changing into new denim products.Education or tutorials. Gaming company Backyard worked with an up-and-coming TikTok influencer on a tutorial for one of their popular games.Unboxings. Apple works with influencers for product unboxings. By partnering with TikTok influencers, they make their products feel more accessible.Comedy. Red Bull works with TikTok influencers to create comedy videos featuring their products.TikTok is volatileTikTok has a high-variance algorithm. Meaning, the impressions that creators' posts get aren’t constant. So pay for performance or pay for a package of multiple videos.One outcome of that variance: Smaller influencers can have more power than they do on other platforms. If a video is good, it gets boosted. It’s that simple. Because of that, TikTok is better for discovery than most other platforms. It can be worth taking a chance on smaller creators if they’re very talented and you believe in their ability to break out.Suggested strategyTo find Tiktok influencers, consider an app like Swipehouse, which allows you to break down your campaign and get inbound requests from high-quality influencers. You can sort through your inbounds and work with the creators who fit your brand.Split your budget: Work with a few bigger creators, but take bets on a large number of small creators.Because of TikTok’s high-variance algorithm, we recommend giving creators even more creative freedom than you would on other platforms—they really need to hit an authentic nerve for videos to go viral. Restricting their creativity won’t get you closer to hitting that nerve.Other ways to incentivize influencersThere are two types of influencer activations that require more nuance: gifting and whitelisting.GiftingSome brands bypass paying cash to influencers. Instead, they “gift” them: They send products for free.This generally works with nano-influencers (influencers with fewer than 10k followers). Nano-influencers typically build small followings on social media alongside their other pursuits. This isn’t their full-time job, so they’re more likely to be satisfied with free products instead of cash.Pros of gifting:It’s easy to get started with because it’s affordable—your only costs are inventory and time.Brands get their products directly into the hands of creators, who can then try them without having to discover them on their own. If they like your product, they might share it with their audience for free—and even give you better rates on paid sponsorships.Content that influencers make as a result of gifting is usually genuine, since they’re not obligated to post to fulfill a paid sponsorship. This quality content may be repurposable into ads.Cons:It’s harder to make gifting work with bigger influencers. They'll generally only work with you if you agree to pay them, since this is their full-time job.You might wind up competing with brands that do offer to pay nano-influencers.It takes a lot of time to find creators who will agree to promote your gifts—it’s hard to execute at scale. And you need scale for impact.Gifting could be another playbook entirely, since it demands a different approach. We suggest starting with our 80/20 affiliate model. Then, once you’ve proven influencer marketing as a channel, you could test process-driven gifting at scale, to compare your ROI with the affiliate model's.We also recommend checking out EAG if you're ready to test gifting—that's their bread and butter. They've scaled many brands through gifting campaigns with nano-influencers.WhitelistingWhitelisting refers to running paid ads through influencers’ accounts. With normal “organic” influencer marketing, you’re reaching influencers’ existing audiences—those who follow their accounts. But with whitelisting, you’re effectively taking over influencers’ accounts and running ads out of them, to reach people who don’t yet follow those influencers.Why would you use whitelisting?It’s influencer marketing at scale. You're continuously reaching new audiences, and you’re not capped by influencers’ followings. It's social proof. Running ads through influencer accounts signals that those influencers support your brand and product. It’s a stamp of approval—a heavily weighted testimonial. People are more likely to engage with whitelisted ads than classic brand ads.Influencers are often willing to create more good content for you. Why? Because you’re putting ad dollars behind their accounts—and they’re getting new followers as a result. You’re helping them promote themselves. They're more likely to create content for free if you agree to put a certain number of ad dollars behind their account.Note the “sponsored” tag below each creator's username.You can use a platform like Lumanu to run your whitelisting campaigns. It integrates directly with Facebook Ads Manager, and you can quickly put together A/B tests.To get results from whitelisting, you’ll need to understand how paid social acquisition works. The process is much more like running paid social ads than navigating influencer relationships.(We share tactics for running paid ads in our Growth Newsletter, which goes out to 50k+ marketers.)Tracking resultsGiving coupon codes and special links for influencers to share helps account for some conversion. But they won’t tell the whole story. People will often hear about your product from an influencer, then think about it later and come back to your site in a way that’s not tracked to that particular influencer. The workaround? Combine analytics data with an attribution survey. Implement a post-purchase survey, and ask customers where they heard about you. List specific influencers as options.Although your link data may show a low ROAS, you’ll likely find that your influencers are actually bringing in a higher ROAS once the survey data is accounted for.There are tools like Enquire for Shopify that can get you 80%+ completion rates for post-purchase surveys.What a job well done looks likeHere are two examples of companies that have scaled through influencer marketing, taking different approaches.Daniel WellingtonDaniel Wellington scaled their brand through an ambassador influencer marketing program. Here’s how they made it work:They teamed up with influencers whose audiences best matched their highest-LTV customers.They sent their influencers watches and had them create and post content on Instagram (feed and Stories).Each influencer provided their audience with a unique coupon code (10-20% off).Codes tracked influencer performance, so Daniel Wellington was able to add/drop influencers based on conversion.They also repurposed influencer content for their own Instagram and website, stretching ROI.Health Via Modern Nutrition (H.V.M.N.)H.V.M.N. took a slightly different approach. The main goal of their influencer marketing was to scale content creation for their social channels, website, and ads.So they created a gifting ambassador program.They sent free product to nano- and micro-influencers (fewer than 50k followers).Influencers created content on H.V.M.N.’s behalf.Influencers also received a discount code to share on social.The creative assets generated helped H.V.M.N:Cut $8K/month in creative costs—they didn’t have to pay for contentLower their Facebook CPA by 25%—influencer content resonated with H.V.M.N.’s ad audiences‍<- Previous ChapterNext Chapter ->Cheat sheetWe've trimmed our strategy section into a concise cheat sheet. Below, you’ll find all the tactics without the context or reasoning. Consider this a checklist for you to reference while you implement your influencer strategy. Start with InstagramInstagram influencer marketing is already validated across most industries.Members of your team probably already have Instagram accounts where they're at least occasionally active. Most influencer marketing tools are built around Instagram. You can leverage Facebook’s infrastructure.Set aside 15 hours per week at minimumInfluencer marketing takes serious work. Set aside time for:Finding and assessing influencers at scaleCommunicating with and onboarding influencersManaging long-term relationshipsDeciding on incentive structures and payoutsSetting goals and measuring successAutomating to reduce CPARunning experiments to improve performanceStep 1: Find influencersLook for influencers whose audiences match your target consumer:Geography broken down by country, then state, then cityAgeGenderTopics of interestStart your search manually to get a lay of the land:Look at relevant, high-performing brands: Search for influencers who are tagging adjacent brands by navigating to the “Tagged” sections of their profiles.Search for high-quality content by location.Look at the hashtags #sponsored, #paid, or #ad, combined with hashtags in your niche.Crawl your DMs/tags for influencers who are reaching out to you.Then use a SaaS tool to confirm that their audience data matches what you target:ModashCreatorIQDovetaleInfluentCheck for engagementUse Modash’s fake follower tool to check your influencers’ percentage of fake followers. You should be skeptical of anything over 25%.Start with ambassadorsPay through an affiliate model (unique URLs or personalized discount codes) and form long-term relationships with these influencers.Step 2: Optimize your workflowFinding and analyzing influencers at scaleUse your influencer tools to track ongoing performance data (conversions, audience demographics, etc.).Leverage this data to decide which influencers to work with. Drop underperforming influencers and niches and double down on influencers whose audiences are converting at higher rates.First contact and onboardingBuild a landing page for influencers so they can easily figure out how your program works. Include:Benefits of joiningRequirements (like minimal follower count)CTAs to collect their informationBonus: social proof to increase conversionAutomate your communication so you’re not spending a lot of time managing relationships. You can do this through your influencer tools:Start by sending an influencer a DM on Instagram.Simultaneously, send them an email and mention that you also DMed them.Consider commenting on their Instagram posts if you don’t hear back on 1 or 2.A 50%+ response rate proves that your messaging is working.Incentive structuresExperiment with incentives to improve your influencer ROI. A few options for tests:Run a one-month promotion, with creators getting paid 25%+ per conversion.Give free products or gift card bonuses for accomplishing different goals.Randomly highlight one of your influencers in your newsletter and on your blog, influencer page, and social media channels.Continually increase the monthly conversion quota.Step 3: Optimize the channelTwo tactics to increase your ROI:Regularly share what’s working with your creators, so they can convert better.Leverage influencer-generated content in your ads and on your social media feed and landing pages to stretch out your influencer marketing spend.Step 4: Invest in your relationshipsWith influencer marketing, you’re working with humans, not dashboards.Become friends with your influencers.Respond quickly, and avoid canned responses.Let them try your product first.Set clear expectations.Get them excited.Limit admin work when possible.Invest more deeply in existing relationships.Most importantly: Give away creative control.

They use whichever tools their marketers used at past jobs—and leave it at that.But startups that design their marketing stacks properly can outpace others. They:Grow faster—thanks to quicker iteration and more automation. No one has to be repeatedly reminded to make important growth decisions.Save resources—thanks to needing to make fewer hires and spend less time in dashboards.Here's the challenge, though: There are over 7,000 marketing tools to choose from.We interviewed 100+ growth marketers from the fastest-growing B2B, mobile, and D2C startups to identify which tools they use and how they connect them for:Customer acquisitionEngagement and conversionAnalyticsIn this playbook, you'll learn the answer to the question: Is my team using the latest and greatest marketing tools? If the answer is no, you'll know which tools to try instead.Unlike our other playbooks, which feature advanced content, this is an introductory playbook. Its purpose is to help beginners learn about popular marketing tools and know when to use them.Credit: Skyword.comGenerally recommended toolsBriefly, here's a list of the most popular tools startups say they choose. The rest of this guide adds context and strategy to these recommendations.ContentClearscope: Helps you optimize your written content for SEO.Ahrefs: Best for performing SEO research, such as keyword and backlink analysis.Semrush: More full featured (and complicated) than Ahrefs, with a stronger focus on ads than organic.Landing pagesUnbounce: The most flexible landing page builder. It's used to create custom pages that convert new visitors into users.Instapage: Another landing page builder, with slightly less flexibility than Unbounce. Some marketers prefer it because of its large design template library.Webflow: The most full-featured landing page builder, but a lot more complicated to use. You can use it to build entire sites from scratch.No-code automationZapier: Zapier allows non-technical marketers to do the work of back-end engineers. You can set it up so that an action in one tool triggers an action in another.Customer datamParticle: A customer data platform (CDP)best for consumer businesses. mParticle automatically logs events such as user sign-ups, then routes that data into your other marketing tools. It's the foundation for many marketing stacks.‍Segment: Another option for your CDP—better for B2B companies.Note: CDPs are used to manage customer behavior data. CRMs (customer relationship management platforms) manage interactions with customers. Both track customer data, but CRMs do it for customer-facing interactions, and CDPs are more behind the scenes. We’ll use both terms throughout this playbook.Live chatIntercom: The best all-around live chat/customer engagement tool.Drift: Best for sales-heavy organizations given its extensive chat automation features, which qualify and book leads.Data enrichmentClearbit: You can use Clearbit to find "people data"—like email addresses and job titles. Then you can personalize your website or marketing emails with that data.People Data Labs: A wholesale alternative to Clearbit.Social mediaBuffer: Best for smaller companies, until they outgrow it and move to Hootsuite.Hootsuite: More suited for enterprise companies because of its complexity, deeper features, and cost.AnalyticsAmplitude: A user-level tracking tool with a generous free tier and intuitive UI.Mixpanel: The most popular user-level tracking tool. Rich features include live chat (like Intercom) and Zapier integrations.Google Analytics: The most commonly used analytics tool on the web. Suitable for basic analytics such as page views, bounce rates, and time on site—but not as good for user-level tracking.Heap: Another major (but less popular) user-level tracking tool. Heap's "automatic tracking" generates events for, say, web form submissions and link clicks. But the UI can be cumbersome.OptimizationGoogle Optimize: A free A/B testing tool from Google that integrates with Google Analytics and Google Ads. Less featured than Optimizely, but it's free and does what most startups need.Optimizely: The most full-featured A/B testing platform on the market.Hotjar: The best tool for capturing heatmaps and user recordings to assess user behavior.Fullstory: A more expensive, better-featured, and more in-depth user session recording alternative to Hotjar.AttributionSingular: The top-rated attribution solution.Branch: The best mobile-focused attribution solution.Rockerbox: A popular option for ecommerce.PaymentsStripe: The go-to payment processing tool because of its ease of implementation.Bill.com: The go-to accounts payable and receivable platform. If your vendors/customers are already using Bill.com, payments are frictionless.Braintree: A great payment processing option for ecommerce companies, known for its powerful fraud prevention tools.Affirm: Used by ecommerce companies to offer payment plans to customers.Here's a breakdown of common marketing stacks for different business model types:Before you commit to specific tools, your business model, acquisition strategy, and target customers should all be aligned. That way, you'll be able to select the tools that will make growth easier for your business—instead of just going with the most popular ones.Our Growth Program can help you with this. In it, you'll:Build a growth engine to acquire new customers, based on your startup's model.Execute proven growth tactics. You'll work with a dedicated growth advisor, who will make sure your time is spent on activities that drive real growth.We've also partnered with many of the tools mentioned in this playbook to offer exclusive discounts to Growth Program members—for over $10,000 in savings. And we're constantly adding new tool discounts.Get a free sample of the Growth Program.How to design your marketing stackDesign your marketing technology (martech) stack as the solution to your bottlenecks.Example of a resource bottleneck: A B2B company that manually sends emails to nurture leads can switch to a semi- or fully automated approach for greater efficiency.Example of a conversion bottleneck: A B2C ecom company that struggles to convert users at checkout might use heatmaps to determine where to make UX changes. The goal would be to eradicate large drop-offs in their funnel and increase conversion.So your first step in tool selection should be to study your customer's journey and find the bottlenecks. The second step: Audit your team's workflows. Look for redundant tasks that could be replaced by software.Let's start tackling marketing objectives.Capturing leadsIn this section, we'll focus on:Running adsCreating content for search enginesLeveraging organic social mediaBuilding landing pages that convertRunning ads‍Ads are one of the most scalable and efficient ways to acquire customers.Ad channels include:Facebook/InstagramGoogle AdsPinterestTwitterLinkedInSnapchatRedditFacebook, Instagram, and Google account for over 60% of digital ad spend.Most marketers run ads directly through each platform. For example, you can run Facebook ads through your Facebook Ads Manager or Google Ads through your business Google account.But there are tools that make creating, running, and tracking ads easier—especially when you're running ads across many channels at once.Need helping running ads? We've run ads for 100+ startups. Check out Ad Labs.AdEspressoAdEspresso lets you run Facebook, Instagram, and Google campaigns through one dashboard.It makes sense to use AdEspresso if:You're running multiple campaigns across ad platforms, and you lack the resources to do a deep dive into each channel’s ads manager dashboard on a daily basis.You're a generalist who doesn't have time to learn the nuances of every ad channel's dashboard. AdEspresso is convenient. You learn their dashboard—that's it.You work with a team that requires sign-offs on your campaigns. You can queue up ads, then a team member can launch them later with a few clicks.SmartlySmartly automates ads on social channels, e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snap.You can create ads, run campaigns, and analyze your data from one location.Two key differences between AdEspresso and Smartly:Smartly includes Snap and Pinterest but not Google Ads. In contrast, AdEspresso includes Google Ads but not Snap or Pinterest.Smartly leverages AI to dynamically show the copy and creative that should resonate most with your audience.Use Smartly if:You run ads on Pinterest or Snap.You'd benefit from dynamic copy and creative in your ads.You're new to ads and want to put them on autopilot. Smartly will automatically optimize your targeting, budgets, and bidding to improve conversion.A quick note on Google AdsYou can use martech tools to get the most out of your Google Ads campaigns:Semrush provides data on keywords in your niche, to help you make data-driven decisions about which to include in your Google Ads campaigns. You can also search for keywords that competitors are ranking for and run competing campaigns.Ahrefs is another keyword tool, but its emphasis is more on SEO and less on search ads. We'll cover Ahrefs in the upcoming section on content.Use Google Optimize (the A/B testing tool) for dynamic text replacement. On your landing page, you can dynamically insert the keyword that triggered your ad to be shown to the searcher. This improves personalization and, hopefully, conversion.Credit: GoogleEach of these tools addresses the fact that Google Ads have intent-based targeting. They target people who want to answer timely questions or solve existing problems. Keyword and personalization tools home in on those unique intentions.Creating contentAhrefsRecommended by TripAdvisor, LinkedIn, Netflix, Pinterest, and AdobeAhrefs, a technical SEO tool, helps you find popular keywords that potential customers are searching for. You can place those keywords in your written content or search ads.Use Ahrefs to:Study what your customers are searching for. You can find keyword ideas and analyze keywords' ranking difficulty and estimated traffic potential.Optimize your website. By running an analysis on your site, you can find out what’s holding it back from ranking better for certain keywords.Analyze your competitors. See which keywords your competitors are ranking for and using for PPC campaigns. Consider launching campaigns that challenge competitors.Credit: AhrefsAlternatives: Semrush, MozClearscopeRecommended by Twilio, HubSpot, Intuit, and YouTubeOnce you've identified your top keywords, you can use Clearscope to optimize your content's Google search rankings.Clearscope is a keyword research and content optimization tool.You copy and paste your content into Clearscope.It analyzes your content and returns keyword modification recommendations.Then its grading tool tells you how likely you are to be a top 10 search result, and what terms to include in your headers, subheaders, and body text to get there.How to convert your trafficWhen people arrive at your site through your content, you need a way to incentivize them to provide their email address, so they can move along your funnel.Two methods:Email capture tools: Most email marketing platforms (from Customer IO to Mailchimp) have built-in tools to capture emails, like popups and in-line email boxes. If your platform doesn't provide these tools, check out Sumo, Optinmonster, and Sleeknote.‍Quiz tools: Entice users to take a quiz, but have them submit their email address to get their results. You can use Typeform or SurveyMonkey to create your quiz.Leveraging organic social mediaThere are two types of social media channels: persistence channels and hit-or-miss channels.Twitter and LinkedIn are persistence channels—growth comes from posting regularly. If you post excellent content consistently, growth is all but guaranteed.Hacker News, Reddit, and Product Hunt, on the other hand, are hit-or-miss channels. You're chasing a viral hit. To rank highly, you need to outperform others through phenomenal content.The ROI of pursuing hit-or-miss channels is volatile, and it's hard to be consistent. So we recommend focusing on persistence channels.All the tools we discuss below can remove friction for persistence channels. They don't usually support hit-or-miss channels. Instead, you'll work directly within hit-or-miss channels' UI to post content.BufferRecommended by Stripe, Intercom, Basecamp, Trello, and GithubBuffer helps you publish content across social media platforms—Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter—in just a few clicks.It lets you:Schedule posts for the best times of day for maximum engagement. While we're on the topic, here are the best times for the top four social channels: Facebook: 12pm EST, Twitter: 11am to 1pm EST, Instagram: 12-1pm EST, LinkedIn: 7:45am, 10:45am, 12:45pm, and 5:45pm EST.Collaborate with your team to go through review rounds before publishing.Measure and continually improve the performance of your content, using Buffer’s built-in analytics.You can also connect Buffer to Slack to get notified about Twitter replies.HootsuiteRecommended by Marketo, SXSW, and Meliá HotelsHootsuite is a social media management tool trusted by many Fortune 500 companies. Startups often find themselves choosing between Hootsuite and Buffer.Here are the key differences:Buffer is less expensive, but Hootsuite provides deeper features at every plan level.Buffer has a cleaner interface, but it lacks some advanced organizational features that bigger businesses prefer.Hootsuite has a more advanced dashboard. Buffer shows your scheduled posts, while Hootsuite shows your timelines and replies.In short, Buffer is good for small teams, but larger organizations should try Hootsuite.Additional social media toolsA few more tools worth considering:Sprout Social: A highly rated social media management tool that's a competitor to both Buffer and Hootsuite. It's best suited for enterprise businesses. It's functional, easy to use, and intuitive, but it's expensive compared to the other options.Later: Best for businesses that rely on Instagram as their primary channel.Later for Reddit: Lets you schedule Reddit posts in advance.TweetDeck: Social media dashboard for Twitter accounts.Building landing pagesA landing page is the first page people see when they come to your site. It's one of the most important assets for on-site conversion.If you run an ad to promote dog food, don't link to your homepage.Instead, create a custom landing page that caters to dog owners specifically.Great landing pages decrease your cost per click by improving your advertising quality scores on Google.We recommend taking advantage of landing page builders to:A/B test different value propositions quickly.Use heatmaps to see where users stop engaging.Use long-tail keywords to write hyper-specific landing pages that convert better than generic ones.Modify CTAs to match search terms. For example, if someone does a Google search for “rent living room furniture,” they might be more likely to click a CTA that says “rent now” rather than “sign up.” On landing pages, context reinforcement is important.Leverage location data to make your product pages more relevant—e.g., a visitor from Germany would see a "we ship to Germany!" message.The two most popular landing page builders are Instapage and Unbounce. These tools allow you to create custom pages that integrate with your domain—and they don't require coding expertise. You can then iterate on your pages using A/B testing tools.The typical approach to using page builders is to create a subdomain on your site, such as get.demandcurve.com, which becomes the home for your landing page tests. This keeps your main site uncluttered.UnbounceRecommended by Helix, Within, Later, and ZolaUnbounce is a very easy-to-use landing page builder. Here are some features worth knowing about:The "dynamic text replacement" feature lets you display text on your landing page based on the search queries visitors use to arrive at your site.You can A/B test pages and compare your results through Unbounce's built-in analytics dashboard.You can include an email capture on your page, then use Unbounce's native integrations to add new email subscribers to segmented campaigns in your email marketing platform.Use Unbounce if you want the most flexibility for creating pages. It's suitable for experienced marketers with advanced needs.InstapageRecommended by HelloFresh, Ebay, Okta, and TrueCarInstapage is another highly recommended landing page design tool. People love it because of its library of pre-built page templates.Instapage's A/B testing and analytics functionalities are similar to Unbounce's, and it offers lead capture forms that can directly connect to your CRM. We prefer Unbounce for its design, ease of use, and dynamic text replacement. But many startups prefer Instapage. We suggest experimenting with both free trials before choosing one. Speaking of which, Unbounce lets you preview their builder, so you can test it before signing up for a trial.Double your conversion rateSharp copywriting can dramatically increase the conversion rate of your ads and landing pages.In the Growth Program, you'll use copywriting frameworks to build landing pages that double your existing conversion. Get a free sample of the program here.Engagement and conversionOnce you have leads coming in, the next step is to pick the right tools to move them further down the funnel.Here's what we'll cover:Marketing automation (mostly via email)Live chatData enrichmentMarketing automationMarketing automation helps you automate touchpoints throughout a lead's journey. It can streamline:Email marketingLead nurturingIn-app messaging and push notificationsRetargeting adsSMS marketingOperationsAnd moreEmail: Customer IORecommended by Segment, Reddit, and CodecademyCustomer IO is an email automation tool that helps you send targeted messages to users based on how they've interacted with your website. It also doubles as a newsletter-sending tool.Customer IO is a flexible and easy-to-implement solution for data-driven startups and SMBs. It's made a splash with startups because of its ease of use, great design, and flexibility. You can create very complex funnels with it.Some use cases for Customer IO:Send "broadcasts"—like newsletters—to a segment of your mailing list.For ecom startups: Integrate with Shopify's open-source Liquid logic for additional customization.Set up advanced email and SMS workflows that send relevant messages to subscribers and move them further down your funnel.Use welcome flows to introduce your brand and let customers know what they should expect from your emails.Use nurture flows to provide subscribers with valuable resources and nudge them toward purchase.Send transactional emails like receipts, shipping confirmations, and digital product deliveries. (Transactional emails are emails that send to customers automatically when they're transacting with a company.)Analyze your flows by metrics such as open rate, click-through rate, and conversion. Optimize your emails accordingly.You can also push customer engagement data into Customer IO, then enrich it with contact details using Clearbit. This helps you get job titles, company industries, and more, so you can send personalized emails at scale.Alternatives: Mailchimp (newsletters), Klaviyo, Drip (both ecommerce), ConvertKit (personal brands)Workflow automation: IterableRecommended by DoorDash, Fender, Zillow, and AsicsIterable is a leader in automated customer outreach. It spans email, SMS, cross-channel insights, and workflow automation.It's suited for less technically savvy marketers, as it offers powerful features that don't require engineering resources, like:A clean drag-and-drop interface for automation flowsDynamic personalization and segmentation featuresOmni-channel campaignsIterable's cost structure is best for:Mid-sized companiesCompanies with over 100k emails on their listWorkflow automation: SendGridRecommended by Uber, Airbnb, Spotify, Yelp, and InstacartSendGrid is a widely trusted email marketing platform. Its two core benefits are deliverability and scale:SendGrid provides domain authentication, compliance and deliverability coaching, and proactive ISP outreach. What that means is that your emails land in inboxes more often, instead of ending up in spam folders or getting blocked by firewalls.SendGrid's above-average deliverability improves email performance at scale.SendGrid is best for:Email marketing automation and reliable transactional emails. Since SendGrid has the best deliverability among email service providers, transactional emails sent through it almost always reach their intended recipients.Developers and technical marketers, although non-technical marketers can use their drag-and-drop editor.Workflow automation: HubSpotRecommended by SurveyMonkey, ClassPass, Trello, and SoundcloudHubSpot is an all-in-one marketing automation tool and CRM. It's packed with everything from social media management to sales automation.Its marketing platform provides email automation, landing pages, analytics, and CRM tools in a comprehensive package.HubSpot's key benefits:Developers don’t need to integrate a ton of different tools via APIs.Its comprehensive CRM allows for more granular segmentation than less data-heavy email marketing platforms, like Mailchimp.It has a stack of native integrations, and it connects with CDPs (like mParticle or Segment) to personalize email campaigns.HubSpot is best for:Marketers looking for comprehensive solutions and tools for inbound marketingB2B companies that run inbound marketingThe downside? It’s expensive. And more importantly, you're sacrificing the quality of each individual tool (email software, CRM, landing pages, etc.) for the convenience of an all-in-one provider.Credit: ImpactSales emails: MixmaxRecommended by Canva, Typeform, and Trend AnalyticsMixmax helps sales teams close leads through email.It integrates with Gmail and allows you to send automated sequences to large lead lists.Use cases include:Tracking opens, clicks, downloads, and RSVPs by person and message type—and then iterating on sequences to improve response rates.Receiving real-time notifications when people take action on your emails. For example, sales reps can see when a lead opens a message, which could be an ideal time to reach out to them.For sales leaders, integrating Mixmax with Salesforce to monitor their team's performance and ensure that all accounts are up to date.Credit: MixmaxAlternatives: Mailshake, Reply IONo-code integrations: ZapierRecommended by Spotify, Adobe, and BuzzfeedWhereas the automation tools we've covered so far involve communication with customers, Zapier solves a different problem. It's the only tool that lets marketers build automations across all the tools we're discussing.When two tools lack a direct integration, Zapier is a way to connect them. You do this by creating "Zaps": custom automations that work across your tech stack.Say you want to alert your sales team by Slack when a large customer pays through Stripe. You can create a Zap that sends a Slack message to your team's #sales channel when a transaction is processed via Stripe. Then one of your sales reps can reach out to your customer to congratulate them and walk them through onboarding.Use cases:After a user signs up, a Zap can enrich their data using Clearbit; add it to Airtable, a database, and/or a CRM; ping a Slack channel; send a welcome email through Gmail; and log an event in Mixpanel.When a customer schedules a call with a salesperson, a Zap can email them from the salesperson, log an event in Mixpanel, change their CRM stage to "scheduled call," and notify the salesperson in Slack.When a customer cancels their subscription through Stripe, a Zap can email them a confirmation, log an event in Mixpanel, and remove their access to your digital product.When you change someone's Airtable or CRM record to "sent contract," a Zap can have DocuSign send them a contract. Once they sign, another Zap can then set their record to "signed documents" and ping the salesperson.Live chatChat is typically seen as a customer support feature. But it's also an opportunity to connect with qualified leads at a critical moment—and close deals.Once your live chat tool has collected sufficient data from your interactions with customers, you can build automations that are truly helpful for them. For example, if you're frequently answering similar questions about a product feature, you can build an automation into your chat tool that answers those customer questions and saves your team time.IntercomRecommended by Shopify, IBM, Udemy, and MicrosoftAfter installing Intercom, you'll have a small chatbox on your site where customers can quickly get in touch with your team. It can be critically useful for both support and sales.While most people know Intercom for its support functionality, it's also loaded with features for engagement and marketing.Engagement: Use interactive messages and product tours to onboard and activate new customers and reactive current ones.Marketing: Use personalized messages, bots, and real-time chat to convert people on the spot.Some of the top use cases for Intercom include:Integrating with your CRM through mParticle to automatically qualify leads based on their chat responses.Integrating with Calendly, so VIP customers can quickly book calls with your sales team.Asking customers questions related to the Google search queries they used to arrive at your website.Using geotargeting to only allow customers within your key geographies to access your valuable support team, to keep their time well allocated. For instance, if you're selling a product to Canadians, you could use geofencing to only show your chatbot to Canadians.Alternative: DriftData enrichmentData enrichment is the process of consolidating user data to get a better understanding of your customers. It can be used with both data you already have and publicly searchable data.For instance, if you have an email address, you can use data enrichment to get personal and company data associated with that email, like first name, city, income bracket, job title, and so on.You can also use data enrichment to customize your landing pages with visitor-specific value propositions. And you can improve your onboarding experience by showing users the features their personas care about most.ClearbitRecommended by Notion, Outreach, Pantheon, and FlexportClearbit is the industry leader in quality data enrichment, providing up-to-date and accurate data on your leads. You can use Clearbit to find email addresses, LinkedIn profiles, job titles, etc., for almost anyone with an online presence.When you integrate it with Gmail, Clearbit will show you information about the people you're emailing in your sidebar.Its use cases allow you to:Automatically qualify leads (by filtering out those who aren't a good fit).Create personalized onboarding flows.Turn anonymous web traffic into full company profiles that inform your sales process.Turn an email address into a full profile to use for cold outreach.For B2B companies, run ads on Facebook with LinkedIn-level firmographic data. Clearbit has 100+ B2B targeting filters including title, industry, company size, and technology used.People Data LabsRecommended by IBM, PayPal, and StripePeople Data Labs (PDL) is a data-aggregation company that provides the work emails and social media account details of over 2.5 billion people around the world.It has a rich dataset of high-profile decision-makers in the US, UK, and Canada.You can use PDL to enrich your customer (or prospect) data and make better-informed decisions.Use cases include:B2C: Running your CRM through PDL's database to update your data, then using your newly updated data in your marketing campaigns.B2B: Running a sales prospect list through PDL's database to improve personalization of your cold outreach.Alternative: ZoomInfoAnalytics and optimizationAnalytics tools allow marketers to collect meaningful behavioral data. This is then used to optimize campaigns across landing pages, emails, ads, product features, and more.Most tools, like landing page builders, already come with built-in analytics, but they're generally underequipped. The best analytics tools focus only on analytics.Analytics dashboardsIt's best to house all your data in one analytics tool.For instance, it's inefficient for your email team to collect data in Customer IO, while your paid acquisition data lives exclusively in Facebook Ads Manager, and so on.Most marketers are familiar with Google Analytics (GA), Google's free analytics dashboard. We recommend GA as a baseline, but you should upgrade as soon as you can afford to.Paid analytics tools offer deep, event-based insights that GA doesn't provide. The improvement in insight quality will cover the cost of these tools.Analytics is one tool category you don't want to skimp on.AmplitudeRecommended by Instacart, PayPal, Dropbox, Rappi, and Blue ApronAmplitude generates analytics at the user level by tracking users and events across every interaction with your business. It provides customizable, user-friendly dashboards that allow you to sync all your data in one place.Unlike GA, Amplitude is good at tracking people when they switch devices (e.g., phone → laptop). This is important for accurate and thorough data collection across multi-device experiences.You can also use Amplitude to identify behavioral trends that can help you make meaningful product optimizations—not just marketing automations.Popular use cases include tracking:Funnel drop-offRevenue segmented by personaSign-ups segmented by referring domain or sourcePurchases made after blog articles are readWeekly blog traffic growthMixpanelRecommended by DocuSign, Uber, Skyscanner, and TwitterMixpanel is similar to Amplitude in the way it tracks "events" on your site. You can capture details on button clicks, page scrolls, and navigation and get a clear picture of what visitors are doing on each page or view.A popular use case entails integrating live chat tools like Intercom. You can automatically start a conversation with customers based on the actions they take on your site.Additional analytics toolsHeap: A user-level tracking tool with an added benefit of "automatic tracking." Events for form submissions and link clicks are generated automatically, which is helpful if you don't know how to set up tracking.Optimization toolsOptimization tools are used alongside an analytics dashboard to run and validate growth experiments such as A/B tests.Common use cases for A/B testing include:Landing, product, and pricing page copy and designUser onboarding flowsIn-app UXLanding page personalization. You can detect location, UTM tags, or Google Ad IDs to personalize page content, then test whether that personalization has had a measurable impact.OptimizelyRecommended by Mailchimp, StubHub, Salesforce, and Blue ApronWith Optimizely, you can run A/B tests to see which copy, creative, and design variations convert the best.Additionally, you can use Optimizely to direct visitors toward individualized funnels. For example, only some leads are worth your limited sales bandwidth. You could use your lead-scoring data to send visitors with priority sales personas into a more hands-on sales flow.Credit: GetAppGoogle OptimizeIf you’re already using Google Analytics and Google Ads, consider Google's A/B testing tool: Optimize. It's a good-enough and completely free alternative to Optimizely.The main difference between Optimizely and Google Optimize? Optimizely offers better flexibility and insights. We suggest starting with Optimize, then getting a sales demo from Optimizely to see if it's worth the upgrade.Credit: GoogleHotjarRecommended by Brex, Adobe, SurveyMonkey, and JetHotjar is a click heatmap and screen recording tool that provides insights into how users interact with your website and app.Credit: HotjarHeatmaps allow you to see where users click on your page and how far down they scroll. This is a proxy for how engaging your page's various elements and value propositions are. It helps you learn what to cut and what to revise.Heatmaps are equally useful for discovering what distracts users. If users spend a lot of time looking at and clicking in a low-value part of your page that doesn’t help them convert, it could make sense to remove that section.Use cases for Hotjar include:Compare heatmaps across mobile, tablet, and desktop. Each has its own UX idiosyncrasies. A site that converts well on desktop doesn't necessarily convert well on mobile.Run heatmaps alongside Optimizely tests to see how your A/B tests affect page interaction.By studying scroll maps, you can identify the sections of your page that users gravitate toward. You can use this data to reorder sections, putting the best content first. The goal is to keep iterating until your page has nothing but attention-grabbing content that leads visitors to the next step in your funnel.AttributionAttribution is the process of collecting visitor and user information at different touchpoints of the customer journey. You often do this using cookies or UTM tags in your URL.Attribution tools can help you determine which touchpoints drive conversion. If you're running a multi-touch campaign, attribution tools can show you which ads or blog articles actually drive purchases.But it gets tricky: Customers rarely convert after engaging with only one of your channels or pieces of content.Instead, they engage with your brand across channels and over the course of a journey. A customer journey might look like this:A prospect sees your FB ad.They Google your company and click to your website.They read one of your blog posts.They forget about you for a month.Then they hear your brand name in a podcast ad, return to your site, and purchase.Out of all that, which touchpoint led to the sale?Well, they all played a part. It's this type of cross-channel attribution that's tough to track. That's where attribution tools come into play.SingularRecommended by Wish, Wealthfront, LinkedIn, Airbnb, and DoorDashSingular is a marketing attribution platform that aggregates data and calculates the ROI of your campaigns. It integrates with over 2,000 tools.Singular has 50% of the 200 top-grossing apps among its customers. It's a safe pick.Its main value proposition is that it aggregates ad channel performance into a single dashboard.Use Singular to:Measure the ROI of specific channels in a multi-touch campaign. This helps you uncover your least profitable channels and the breakouts you should double down on.Thoughtfully portion out ad spend across the entire customer journey.BranchRecommended by Pinterest, Strava, and InstacartBranch provides best-in-class attribution for mobile. It uses deep linking, meaning it pieces together fragmented identifiers to provide a full picture of a customer’s journey. It does this across the web and your mobile app.Branch is helpful in a post-IDFA world—it uses a predictive attribution algorithm to track conversions when there's no universal tracking ID. The rest of the industry relies on basic probabilistic methods, with accuracy rates of 60-70%, whereas Branch appears to have better data and results.Additional attribution platformsRockerbox: A DTC powerhouse that covers attribution for both digital and “non-UTM” channels (e.g., TV, radio, direct mail).AppsFlyer: A mobile attribution platform that specializes in app-install attribution. Because of its cost, it's best for mobile companies spending at least $1 million per year on advertising.Turn analytics into revenueAnalytics are only useful when they inform high-leverage decisions.Our Growth Program includes step-by-step video walk-throughs of how to set up your analytics. Once they're in place, you'll be able to run experiments that drive meaningful growth. Try a sample of the program.Integrating your stackNow let's walk through integrating your new tools into a scalable marketing engine.Use a CDP to create your data foundationSince most companies have data coming into their ecosystem in all sorts of ways, it’s tough to keep it standardized. Tools often don't share data with each other.So the first step of creating a unified marketing stack is to set up a customer data platform (CDP). This is the foundation for all your tools.CDPs consolidate customer data from sources like websites and mobile apps in real time. They create and update customer profiles that can power marketing and analytics tools instantly. They integrate all your tools and provide code-free access. And in doing so, they provide your marketing team with autonomy from engineering.The two top CDPs on the market are mParticle and Segment.mParticleWe recommend mParticle to all of the consumer businesses we work with here at Demand Curve. CDPs are often viewed as difficult to integrate and use. Not mParticle. Their integration is seamless, and their UI is easy to navigate. mParticle is often a less expensive alternative to Segment. For these reasons, consumer companies tend to prefer mParticle.In addition, while some CDPs only store and process data, mParticle enables you to automate complex marketing processes using rules and conditional logic. And as marketing becomes privacy-first, mParticle becomes more valuable—mParticle records all opt-ins and opt-outs, so you’ll never hit someone with an unwanted piece of messaging. You’ll spend far less time managing privacy regulations.SegmentSegment is best for B2B companies, since mParticle focuses solely on consumer businesses. But Segment also has comprehensive and accurate data. BonusBelow are a few more tools we like. We’ve found them to be useful for project management and design.Project managementAirtableAirtable is a wildly powerful productivity tool. It's a database-like replacement for Google Sheets for non-calculation work. It's sort of like a spreadsheet on top of a database.Airtable also provides a convenient way to organize project tasks. You can switch views between spreadsheets, calendars, and galleries, and you can create fully customized forms.Use cases:Create a sales CRM.Build a content calendar or distribution queue. (You can even use Airtable's Twitter app to automatically tweet on scheduled dates.)Create project management dashboards, similar to Trello or Asana.Build no-code versions of products using embedded Airtables, like our Hook Vault.Airtable keeps a database of templates and use cases called Airtable Universe. Check it out here.NotionNotion is a robust content workspace for teams. It allows you to create custom systems for note taking and project and knowledge management.Think of Notion as a company wiki + Google Drive replacement + project management tool. Your team can collaborate and share all your important files in one workspace.Notion is also useful for preparing external documents to share on the web. Some startups (and individuals) go as far as using Notion for landing pages.Here are some of the most popular use cases for Notion:Create a company wiki to answer common questions and onboard new employees.Visualize your product roadmap and work cross-functionally to build it.Create a content release calendar.Credit: NotionClickUpClickUp is an all-in-one project management tool. Compared to other project management tools like Asana and Trello, it's become a startup favorite for its ability to manage tasks, docs, chats, and goals in one spot. It's a super-app that replaces all other project management tools.For smaller startups, ClickUp is also a more attractive option than Asana because its free plan includes more features. And when you do upgrade, ClickUp is half the price of Asana.Here are a few problems that ClickUp addresses:Having to navigate many tools (Google Sheets for spreadsheets, Basecamp for announcements and file access, Asana for project management, etc.).Not knowing what everyone on your team is working on. You can use transparent "spaces" to get a feel for what others are prioritizing.Poor cross-team collaboration. For instance, your designer and VP of growth can share a dashboard to collaborate on ads before running campaigns.Alternatives: Asana, TrelloCreativeFigmaFigma is the go-to collaborative design tool for startups. Use it to design ads, landing pages, social media content, and more—across your entire team.A core benefit of Figma is the ability to have multiple people working in a single workspace. The importance of this can't be overstated. You can now work on a project with other team members without worrying about overlapping edits. It’s useful for projects with many handoffs between marketers and designers (or developers) before publication.Other benefits of Figma include:It lets you easily and rapidly prototype product suggestions, without wasting valuable developer time.It uses CSS properties, so anyone on your team can copy-paste its visuals into code.CanvaCanva is another simple, easy-to-use design tool. We like it for its thousands of free templates, and because it lets laypeople quickly build creatives of nearly every type.Example marketing stacksHere are a few case studies showing how different companies can leverage their marketing stacks.1. Create an automated marketing workflowYou run a small DTC ecommerce company. You've been experimenting with marketing automation by using Customer IO to build email flows that sell on your behalf. Simultaneously, you've been testing PPC through Google Ads to drive traffic to your site.Here's a look at a potential interaction with one of your customers:Marketing action: You start by using Semrush to find a list of high-intent search keywords. Then you run Google Ads using those keywords.Customer action: A lead searches for a keyword, clicks on your ad, and arrives at your landing page.Marketing action: Your email-capture popup in Customer IO triggers when the lead scrolls halfway down your landing page.Customer action: The lead reads your content, scrolls, and signs up for your newsletter via the popup.Marketing action: You’ve set up a newsletter welcome email via Customer IO that goes out to all new subscribers. It's segmented by engagement, so when someone clicks on a link in the email, they get more content that’s relevant to that specific link two days later.Customer action: The lead gets the welcome email and clicks on a link in it. Two days later, she gets an email about a blog post related to the link she clicked. She reads the post.Marketing action: In parallel, you're running a retargeting campaign on Instagram (through FB Ads Manager) to people who've visited your site twice in the last seven days.Customer action: While scrolling on Instagram one night, the lead clicks the retargeting ad. She decides she's interested in buying. So she adds your product to her cart, but then fails to check out—she gets distracted by a call from a friend.Marketing action: You’ve set up an abandoned-cart email in Customer IO. It emails people when they add items to their cart but don't complete their purchase.Customer action: Later that evening, the lead gets an email reminding her that your product is in her cart. She clicks through the email and buys the product.The best part about the above interaction? No one on your team had to lift a finger. The ads and emails were already built—and can sell your product well into the future.2. Optimize your onboarding flowImagine you run a startup that sells a Chrome extension. You acquire customers with ease, but a large percentage of users drop off during onboarding. Here's how you can solve the issue:You set up Amplitude to determine the precise step where most users fall off. You discover that most drop off on an information-capture page.Next, you use Hotjar's heatmaps and screen recordings to identify the reason for the drop-off. You notice that users start filling out the form, but they bounce before completing it.You hypothesize that you'd have a higher onboarding rate if users didn't have to fill out so many data fields. So you shorten the form.The bottleneck is fixed, but you decide that you can improve your onboarding conversion rate ever further.You use Optimizely to test improvements at each step of your onboarding process. You run A/B tests to see if adjustments to copy, CTAs, and visuals improve completion rates.The result? A significant boost in onboarding completion—which translates to a lower acquisition cost.3. Grow your top of funnel through a giveawayYou're the head of growth at a DTC brand. Product giveaways are a proven channel for you, so you run them frequently. For the first time, you're putting ad dollars behind the giveaway.You create a custom "giveaway" landing page using Unbounce.You use Buffer to schedule an organic social media post that highlights your giveaway (and you link to the landing page in your Instagram bio).Once the post is live, you run Instagram ads (through your FB Ads Manager) using a lookalike audience of your existing customers. The CTA on the ad brings people to your giveaway landing page.The ads, combined with the giveaway, help you capture the emails of best-fit customers—at a lower cost per email than you'd have without the giveaway campaign.As you capture emails through Instagram, they're automatically added to a segmented flow in Iterable, which moves them down funnel toward a purchase.Staying up-to-date with toolsAs your company scales, your needs will change. Keep an open mind, and when you come across a better tool, consider trying it out. Switching isn't easy, but you could save hundreds of hours by moving to a tool that's a better fit for you and your startup.New to Demand Curve?

Sell. Grow. We’ll go through each of these in detail in this playbook, with one goal: optimize for conversions. We focus on purchase conversion—getting people to buy from you—because it translates directly into revenue. It’s critical for startup growth. In a 2021 survey of about 2,800 Shopify stores, the average conversion rate was 1.6%. That means less than 2% of the people who visit online stores wind up purchasing. If yours is higher than 3.5%, you’re in the top 20% of stores.Higher than 5.1% means you’re in the top 10%.We’ll aim to get you there. In this playbook, you’ll learn:How to set up a high-converting online storeHow to optimize the on-site user experience for increased conversionHow to retain customers and optimize for LTV (lifetime value)We’ve helped thousands of startups accelerate their growth. And many of the ecommerce brands we’ve grown are built on Shopify. Context on ShopifyIf you’re experienced in Shopify and understand exactly who it’s for, skip this section to jump right into building your store.Why use ShopifyShopify is an ecommerce platform where you can build a custom site and sell products online. More than one in four ecommerce businesses uses it. The number one reason for its popularity? It makes both selling and shopping easy. It’s intuitive, agile, and user-friendly—and it integrates with different payment methods.Plus, unlike marketplaces like Amazon or eBay, on Shopify, brand is front and center. You have more control over how your brand is presented and how it makes shoppers feel. One way we’ve seen it put: Amazon’s success came from putting the customer first. Shopify’s came from putting the merchant first.Brooklinen is an example of a startup that found success on Shopify. In 2014, the bedding brand got started after launching a Kickstarter with a $50,000 goal. By 2020, they were raising $50 million in funding—and making nearly $100 million annually.They succeeded because of a smart growth marketing strategy centered on customer insights and data, and because their product has strong word of mouth. But if they didn’t have a site built to drive conversions, nothing else they did would have mattered. They’d be a stat, like so many other ecommerce ventures that never got off the ground.Brooklinen’s Shopify store is laid out for conversions. Its homepage uses a few of the high-conversion tactics we’ll discuss in this playbook, including a banner with a discount and countdown, social proof, and an irresistible hero image. They use some of the apps we’ll discuss too, like Yotpo and Klaviyo.We’ll go over the site elements that stores like Brooklinen use to grow sales, so your own brand can try them out too.How Shopify has evolvedShopify has been around since 2006. Now it’s used by 1.75 million merchants in 175 countries.The pandemic accelerated the shift to ecommerce, and Shopify’s revenue jumped 86% from 2019 to 2020. The rise in ecommerce is great for startups in the D2C sphere, but that trend comes with two caveats: One, the competition is getting tougher. There were 165,000 Shopify merchants in 2015. From 165k to 1.75 million is a 1,000%+ increase.This quote from Naval back in 2012 sums up what tech companies like Shopify have enabled:‍Two, cart abandonment is also increasing. Pre-pandemic, ecommerce shoppers abandoned their carts about 70-80% of the time. For some industries, that number rose to nearly 95% with the onset of Covid. One theory is that our online shopping style now more closely resembles our pre-pandemic window-shopping habits. We look, we make a mental note, we move on. But with online shopping, that mental note takes the form of a soon-forgotten "add to cart." What that means is that it’s not enough to launch a site on a whim and see what happens. Given the rise in competition and cart abandonment rates, starting a Shopify store is only worth it if you build, optimize, and market strategically.Who it’s forGuess which of these brands and people have Shopify stores:Pepsi Fashion NovaJustin BieberGEKanye WestThe answer is all of them. Shopify is typically thought of as a platform for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses. That’s true, but billion-dollar and Fortune 500 companies are on there too. And it’s used by both strictly ecommerce brands and brands selling through ecommerce and brick and mortar. Companies of any size can use Shopify, from just-starting-out small businesses to global enterprises.As for product categories, pretty much anything physical has the potential to sell on Shopify. The team at Shopgram crawled 700k+ Shopify sites and found the top categories to be, in order: clothing, jewelry, home & garden, fashion accessories, and health & beauty. Shopify themselves provided a list of trending products to sell in 2022. The top ten are: toys, shoes, pens & pencils, decorative bottles, drills, cutters, GPS systems, bras, car parts, and office chairs.Size doesn’t matter. Product categories run the gamut. But what is fixed and definitive is the need for product-market fit. No startup will succeed on Shopify without first knowing that what they’re selling has an audience.How to build a high-converting storeLet’s start building your store.We’ll cover three critical pages: your homepage, product pages, and checkout page. Then we’ll walk you through additional conversion tools and help you optimize your store for conversion.But before we dive into pages, we’ll cover a few basics: domain names and Shopify themes.Set up a discoverable custom domainBy default, your Shopify URL is a combination of your store name and “myshopify.com”: storename.myshopify.com. When you’re ready to launch your new store, we recommend using a custom domain to remove that tag and draw attention to your brand, not your platform.If you don’t already have an existing domain, you can buy one directly through Shopify, or you can use a third-party domain registar. One option isn’t drastically better than the other, but here are two points to consider:The upside of buying a new domain through Shopify: It’s easy. You can buy a domain directly through your Shopify account, and it’s automatically configured to be what customers see in their address bar.The downside: It’s often slightly cheaper to go with a third-party registrar. Plus, if you ever decide to move your store off Shopify, it’ll be a bit more of an effort to transfer your domain (but it’s doable).Should you get creative with your URL? Generally, no. Your URL isn’t the place to ignore the rules, ditch your business name, and add a cute pun. That’ll hurt your store’s SEO and discoverability.But you might have to get creative if an exact-match domain name isn’t available. If that’s the case, here are some options:Add a verb, like “get,” “shop,” or “try.” After all, your goal is to inspire site visitors to take action—you want them to buy.Add another word. Examples: packagefreeshop.com for Package Free or shethinx.com for Thinx.Use a top-level domain other than .com, like .org, .shop, or your country code (e.g., .ca).Figure out how to pitch and visualize your products with Shopify themesShopify themes are pre-built templates with different layouts and styles.When you’re building your store, you have two options: Use a premade theme or create a custom store.Which should you go with?Short answer: You should probably use a premade theme.Premade Shopify themes are easy to use and affordable, ranging from free themes to $350 for premium themes. Their fonts and color schemes can be altered to fit your brand.They also work right away, and best of all, good ones are designed for conversion. Take this product listing page from the Avenue theme. Its conversion features include a promo banner, product badges, customer reviews, and quick-view shopping.If you lack the technical skills to develop your own custom site, and if you don’t have an engineer on your team, a premade theme is your best bet.The downside of premade themes is that they’re less customizable than custom-built sites. If you do have developers, they’ll be limited feature- and functionality-wise. If total ownership of your site’s front- and backend is more important to you than speed to launch and budget conservation (for both site launch and maintenance/updates), a custom build may be best for your startup.Note that “premade” doesn’t have to mean “cookie cutter.” You can still customize your site. Menswear retailer Ledbury and olive oil brand Diaspora are both built on the Debut theme. They look and operate very differently. ‍Your copy, images, and on-site flow matter more than the theme you pick.Using themes for researchBefore picking a Shopify theme, scroll through them in the Shopify Theme Store to conduct research. Filter by industry type and catalog size to get a sense of the range of layouts and styles. Just absorbing the different options can give you insights into how your products should be displayed for visual and clickable appeal.Look at how themes display on both mobile and desktop. Nearly 75% of ecommerce sales happen through mobile.To see which themes your competitors are using—along with any other Shopify tools they’ve installed—enter their URLs into BuiltWith. You can then click “download list of all websites using Shopify [name of theme]” to see who else is using it too. You may want to hold off on purchasing a theme until you’ve read through the rest of this playbook, since we’ll get into specific conversion features in a bit.How to structure your store homepageYour homepage should be your most trafficked page. It’s what orients site visitors to your brand, and it creates a highly influential first impression.As we go through the elements of a high-converting homepage, bear this formula in mind:You want to emphasize what makes your product desirable, whether it brings pleasure or soothes pain. At the same time, to convert prospects, you’ll need to minimize the amount of effort they have to put in and maximize their understanding of what you offer. Keep your homepage simple, clear, and motivating.Above the foldWhat is the single action you want customers to take when they first reach your site? Whatever it is, make it easy to get started in the first section they see: the above the fold (ATF). We wrote an entire playbook on ATF alone. Bookmark it so you can follow our step-by-step process when you’re ready to create your ATF. Here are a few tips for using your ATF to hook and convert shoppers.Header and subheader: Keep ATF copy short. But your header and subheader shouldn’t be so concise that they don’t convey what your brand is and why it’s the one to buy from. Visitors shouldn’t have to scroll to understand what you offer and how they’ll get value from you.Pure Cycles doesn't have to say much in its ATF to convey what makes it desirable. They don't even include a subheader—that's how concise they're able to get.‍Imagery: Your products are the star of the show here. There are plenty of different formats you can try for ATF styling—from a static image to a slider to video—but no matter what you choose, keep your products at the forefront. Even better: Show them in the real world, being used and loved. Photos with people have a proven track record of increasing conversion.Kirrin Finch's ATF has a slider with revolving images. Each one features people wearing their clothes—and looking great and confident while doing so.Original photos are better than stock photos. Shoppers value authenticity. But if you don’t yet have a library of product images, try Burst, Shopify’s stock photo database.Because they let you display multiple images, sliders are a useful way to promote discounts, limited-time offers, seasonal specials, and new items.Harper Wilde uses a slider to promote new releases, discounts, and their holiday guide.Note about video: Although ATF video can be a captivating first look, it runs the risk of detracting from action-taking. That’s especially the case if having an ATF video means moving your call-to-action button (CTA) below the fold. Only use video in your ATF if it’s critical to conversion. For instance, if prospects need to see how your product works, and video is the best way to demo it, an ATF video might make sense for your brand.CTA: Your ATF is the most important part of your most important page, and your CTA here might be the most important part of your entire site. It’s what grabs attention and drives action.Your CTA verb is very likely to be “shop”; ATF CTAs for ecommerce tend to be “shop now.” If your conversion goal pertains to a particular product or product line, use your CTA to drive traffic to it. Make sure your CTA is high contrast and unmissable.These CTAs stand out and invite clicks. Sources: Nomatic, Clevertify, Nick Mayer Art‍Reminder about mobile: We’ll remind you about mobile throughout this playbook because we’ve seen how easy it is to overlook—especially since we build sites on our computers, not our phones. How does your ATF look on mobile? Are images cropped right? Is the CTA visible? Don’t launch without feeling good about the answers to those questions.Below the foldA portion of your users will scroll down on your homepage. Below the fold is where you can expand on the information you’ve already provided and continue to drive conversion-related action.Some elements you might include below the fold are: Best sellers: Highlight your flagship and most popular items.Social proof: Share reviews, press, user-generated content (UGC), testimonials, and endorsements. Tip: Include social proof near your CTAs. When shoppers see your CTAs, objections will often pop into their heads before they click through. But if they see social proof nearby, it might be enough to handle objections and get more clicks.Content: This is a better place for video than ATF. It’s also a good place to share popular blog posts that will keep visitors on-site and intrigued by your brand.Brand info: You can use your below-the-fold space to discuss unique product features, special ingredients, brand values, and/or your startup’s mission.Footer: Include pages in the footer that you want to give visitors access to, but that aren’t critical to the conversion journey, like your exchanges and returns policy.Choose and arrange below-the-fold elements based on your customer journey. What is most critical for prospects to see in order to convert? What will drive people to your main CTA? The answers to those questions will vary by brand. A well-established retailer might not need to provide brand info and can focus instead on their flagship products. Anything else might be a distraction. On the other hand, a young startup might need to provide more background details or brand-related content. Mosaic Foods does a fantastic job with their homepage. From top to bottom:They start with an appealing ATF: a happy family enjoying Mosaic’s product, alongside copy that puts the customer first (“you do you,” “entrees the whole family will love”). The ATF is a slider; other slides feature a new product and their flagship line.Next is a full-refund guarantee, addressing a common objection—what if I don’t like it?—right off the bat.This product requires some explanation in order to drive conversions, since many customers will be trying out meal plans for the first time. So they have a “how it works” section next, with as little text as possible to still convey what they do.Next: mouthwatering food photos to get you shopping, and ordering from, their menu.A social proof section (“Satisfaction guaranteed. Seriously.”) adds authenticity. We’d recommend placing a conversion-driving CTA right next to those great reviews.Two short paragraphs emphasize Mosaic’s high-quality ingredients and dedication to sustainability.Before the footer, the page closes out with an email form and logos from recognizable media outlets, for further social proof.Because they make effective use of white space, the page never feels cluttered, even though it has a lot to offer.Be sure to include CTAs throughout your homepage, so visitors don’t have to scroll back to the ATF to take the next step in their buyer journey: toward your product pages.Deep dive on product pagesThe main thing your product pages need to do is convey the value of your products. Right away. Product pages are often where the “aha moment” happens for customers: the instant they feel the strongest emotional response to the benefits your product offers or the problems it solves.Take advantage of the moment when shoppers navigate to your product pages. Create a sensory experience. Use high-quality color photos—93% of shoppers say visuals are a key factor in purchasing decisions. Some themes also let you use videos and 3D models on product pages. Write product descriptions that paint a picture—not just of how great your product is, but of how beneficial it is to the people who use it. And showcase your product reviews, which can help on-the-fence shoppers overcome their hesitation and buy.We’ll go through each of these elements below.Product page layoutQuality product pages tend to look the same for a reason. There’s a conversion-backed formula behind them that’s meant to:Reassure and convert prospects who were leaning toward buying.Win over and convert prospects who were on the fence.What that usually means is an “image at left on desktop, top on mobile” layout, with the “add to cart” CTA at right on desktop and under the image on mobile. Product details are either to the right on desktop or below the fold. You’ll see variations of this layout, but it’s the foundation that product pages are typically built on.It works because it draws attention to the page’s two most important elements: the product image and CTA.The typical product page layout draws attention to the items being sold, like these bracelets from Luca + Danni. ‍If your brand’s aesthetic is particularly unique or experimental—like Outlier—you might be able to break away from the standard formula. But when you’re just starting out, put your creative energy behind visuals and copy, not layout.Reminder about mobile: Remember that your prospect is probably shopping on mobile, not desktop. If you’re designing your product pages on desktop, check their layout and assets on mobile before setting your page live.Product page teardownHere’s a product page we love, with a breakdown of why. Apply the takeaways to your own product pages. Lunchskins product pageProduct imagesLunchskins’ images are bright and fun. Most are static, but one is a gif showing the product in use. Others feature the product in different “action” scenarios, like at a picnic or during reading time. Some have action-driven text on them—like “peel, fold, and GO!”—and a few convey benefits (“convenient,” “compostable,” “toxin-free”).As you scroll through the images, “less plastic, more planet” is always present just below, reminding customers of a key value prop.Takeaways: Your images are your product’s moment to shine. Showcase it in use, and keep visuals bright and inviting.Product Title and DescriptionThe product title highlights benefits—”recyclable” and “sealable”—and is peppered with SEO keywords. It’s followed by an impressive star rating, the price, and Shop Pay text.Then we get to the actions: select a quantity, “add to cart,” and “buy with Apple Pay.” Next are additional benefits (“recyclable,” “food-safe,” and “freezer-safe”), each accompanied by an icon to make them more visually appealing than just plain text would be.The product description and details come next. These are hidden behind expandable plus signs, which works here because the imagery has already conveyed so many of the product’s value props. This also keeps the focus on the CTAs, instead of surrounding them with heavy text blocks.When you expand the description section, you see text that starts off by centering the user, not the product: “a disposable sandwich bag you can feel good about using!” (emphasis added). It then talks up the many practical uses and benefits of the product, as well as an award it won.The product details section features a bulleted list for easy skimming. Lunchskins then explains its refund policy, followed by a section dedicated to its sustainability-related mission.Takeaways: Keep language actionable and user-oriented. Draw attention to your CTAs. Be transparent about your refund policy. And highlight your product’s benefits and brand’s value.Related ItemsBelow its images and description, the product page has a “You May Also Like” section with items that are related to the product. Even better: There are “add to cart” and “Buy with Apple Pay” CTAs under each one, cutting out extra clicks.‍Takeaways: Adding related items to your product page increases upsell and cross-sell opportunities, for a higher average order value. But make sure the items you feature truly are related to the main one. Something off-topic might distract and dissuade.ReviewsThe product page ends on a high note: a selection of impressive reviews. These are authentic social proof that might convert an unsure shopper into a decided one.‍Takeaways: According to a study, 88% of shoppers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Feature reviews on your product page to increase conversions. The app Yotpo can help you collect and display them.Product page bonus: Offer a subscriptionSubscriptions are one of the best ways to boost repeat conversion and lifetime value. And they improve the customer experience by making it easy to reorder.Nature Greens offers a "subscribe & save" option paired with 10% discount.Subscriptions work well for consumable/disposable products like coffee and office supplies. If your product gets used up or worn out, it may be suitable for a subscription. If your business model is subscription-driven, you could have a landing page for subscriptions. Pipcorn does a nice job of outlining the benefits of their subscription plan—a discount on every order, quick cancellation, SMS order management, customization—on a page geared toward subscription conversions.Another option: Offer group discounts on subscriptions, using a Shopify app like Skio. Think of group discounts like Spotify family plans. Users get a discount (say, $5 off every order) for joining your subscription together. This is a mechanism for both growth and retention:Growth: Prospects will pull in family and friends who otherwise wouldn’t buy from you.Retention: There’s a strong incentive not to cancel, since sticking with the subscription means your friends pay less.Keep your checkout page distraction-freeThere’s no need to spend much time customizing your checkout page. Its job is straightforward: Move customers from your product page to purchase. There should be nothing to distract from that one job.Don’t add any non-purchase-related links here. Keep CTAs order-focused, e.g., “place order” or “check out.” In your checkout form, don’t ask for any information you don’t need to complete the order. Should you upsell on your checkout page, using an app like Personalized Recommendations? It’s worth testing. A senior vice president at Amazon was adamantly opposed to offering personalized recommendations during checkout, because of the risk of distraction. But when an employee ran an experiment to test late-stage recommendations anyway, he found that they resulted in a significant boost to revenue. We’ll explain A/B testing later in this playbook. And we’ll discuss ways to reduce friction at this critical moment in the buyer journey.Keep your checkout page simple and distraction-free, like St. Frank’s.More conversion optimization toolsHere are a few more tools you can use to motivate conversion.Offer incentives through popupsAcross industries, the average conversion rate for popups is about 3%. Strategic, high-performing popups can reach ~10% conversion.Use a popup to offer an incentive in exchange for an email address. All brands need to collect email addresses. Unlike third-party platforms that you have little control over, like social media and ad channels, your email list is something you own. Plus, email marketing can have a high ROI: We’ve worked with companies that generate more than $40 in revenue per dollar spent. We’ll explain email marketing for your Shopify store toward the end of this playbook.In your popup, you can offer a discount on a first purchase—for an immediate conversion effect—or free shipping. Or you can offer something longer term, like entry into a giveaway or access to exclusive offers and previews.‍Popups create incentives—and give you another chance to share your brand voice. Sources: Triangl Girls, Fanjoy, Indestructible Shoes‍Discount codes have more uses than just getting emails. They can help prospects get over the mental barrier of placing a first-time order.Free shipping popups have pros and cons. Pro: It’s another way to collect emails. Con: Customers often expect free shipping, period. They don’t want to sign up for it. Given how critical free shipping is to the checkout process, we typically recommend offering it instead of gating it, and using a different incentive in your popup. But if each email on your list is more valuable to your brand in the long run than each conversion, you may decide to gate free shipping.Popup tips:If you don’t see an increase in conversions, trigger your popup discount code to appear after a user has looked at a product or spent a designated amount of time on your site. Try the 60% Rule: Set a popup to appear after 60% of the average time spent on a page, based on your site analytics. At that point, visitors have shown interest in your brand but are nearing the end of their session. Share your incentive while they’re actively engaged.Use popups sparingly. The absolute max is once per session, but we recommend spreading out popups so they don’t appear to a unique visitor more than once a week. Every time you intrude on the customer experience, you’re giving them another reason to leave.Create urgency by emphasizing time and stock limitsOne downside of the rise of ecommerce is that there’s always somewhere else for your prospects to go. To visit your competitor’s shop, they don’t need to get in their car and drive across town. They can just click to another tab.To keep them on-site, add a sense of urgency to their shopping experience. Urgency motivates action. Entrepreneur Marcus Taylor tested two versions of a landing page. One showed just the price of an offer, and another had a “time left to download” countdown above the price. The conversion rate was almost three times higher for the version with the countdown.Some ways you can increase urgency on your Shopify site:Show limited stock levels to highlight scarcity, using an app like Stock Level Inventory Quality.Set a deadline. Add a countdown to indicate how little time is left on a deal, or show customers how soon they should order to get a product by a certain date.Use actionable language in your CTAs, like “shop now” or “subscribe today.”Don’t go overboard by using countdowns, stock limits, and “act fast” language all together. Nobody likes a pushy salesperson, even when that “person” is a piece of code on your website.Offer live chatOne last tip for on-site conversion tools: When prospects have a question but no way to answer it, they might abandon site. Offering live chat is an easy fix. Site visitors who use web chat are 2.8 times more likely to convert. The order value of that conversion increases too: A shopper who uses chat will spend 60% more.Chat helps with both conversion and retention. It’s a form of customer service that can provide immediate support and build longer-term relationships. And if customers have a negative experience, they’ll have a way to address it that’s not on their public social media pages.Some live chat tools to consider are Intercom, Olark, and Drift.If you implement live chat, keep it subtle, especially if you also have a popup. It shouldn’t intrude on the shopping experience by taking up a ton of real estate or covering up your CTAs.MFMG’s live chat is friendly and inviting, and it emphasizes brand values.Not sure what’s converting? Test it.This playbook is based on what we’ve learned while helping thousands of startups scale. But when it comes to ways to improve site conversion, there’s something better than getting external advice: seeing it for yourself.A big part of conversion rate optimization (CRO) is running A/B tests to compare two versions of something. Some of your site visitors see one version (A), and some see another (B). After you’ve gathered enough data to know that one performs better than the other, you use the winning version for all site visitors.The change can be micro, like a single image, or macro, like an entire homepage. Some common on-page CRO changes are headers, subheaders, graphics, CTA copy, and product descriptions. If you’re not sure whether to use video or an image in your ATF, or whether visitors will click a CTA more if it says “shop now” or “get started,” you can run a test to find outWe recommend using Google Optimize when you’re just starting out with A/B testing. It’s a free tool that integrates with Google Analytics—which you should set up for your Shopify site—so you can easily track performance. As your startup scales, you could consider moving over to a more robust (and more expensive) tool like Optimizely. But for now, Google Optimize will give you strong data insights for incremental conversion improvement.Each of those insights will bring you closer to the key to ecommerce success: understanding how your customers behave—and what they want.How to optimize the on-site customer journeyNow that your site is looking great, we’ll go over ways to keep customers on it.Each of the following optimization tactics will improve bounce rate, which could in turn help your conversion rate. You want to give your customers an exceptional user experience so they stay on your site longer, buy from it more, and tell more friends about it.Tactic 1: Make it easy for customers to find and discover productsThe easier it is for customers to discover the right items, the likelier they are to convert. Once they’ve found what they’re looking for, you want to help them discover more products as well. Streamline your navigation, but include any conversion pointsThere’s a fine line between having too little information and too much in your main site menu, sometimes called your navbar.‍‍Too little, and a user might not find what they’re looking for. They’ll bounce.Too much, and they might get overwhelmed by analysis paralysis. They’ll bounce too.Here’s what we recommend for Goldilocks’ing your menu: First, include product categories. Most ecommerce stores do this, but a surprising 18% use one nav item, like “Products” or “Shop,” as a dropdown for all their categories. This damages conversion rates by reducing transparency and sometimes requiring a “double hover”: a hover over the nav item, then a hover over the categories within it.The navbar for Goulet Pens has a dropdown "mega" menu with easy-to-skim groupings.Made In has clear categories in its menu, like "cookware," "bakeware," and "knives." No confusion there.If you have dozens of categories, group them to decrease friction. Adored Vintage groups categories to keep their menu navigable.Order your categories by popularity, with your most popular ones first.Second, keep your menu as simple as possible. Your ultimate goal is conversion, not getting people to read your blog. That’s not to say that every ecommerce site should remove their content marketing and informative pages (e.g., About Us, FAQ, sizing guide) from their menu. For some, those links will help conversion, not hinder it.A general rule of thumb: If your brand has a relatively low—under $50—average order value (AOV) and you’re not selling a complex, ultra-specialized, or mission-driven product, put your informational pages and blog in the footer.Otherwise, it might make sense for you to put those pages in your main menu (navbar). For higher-priced, sophisticated, or story-oriented products, high-quality content marketing and informational pages might factor into the “consideration,” “intent,” and “evaluation” stages of the marketing funnel.Credit: SkywordSustainability is a core value of the Allbirds brand, and Omaze’s charitable commitment guides everything they do. Both brands feature informational pages in their menus.‍What this boils down to is a simple question to ask about any page: Will it help prospects convert? If yes, increase its prominence on your site.One thing that definitely helps with conversion: your shopping cart. Keep your cart visible in your navigation. Some themes have a “sticky” shopping cart option, so it’s always visible as a shopper scrolls.The shopping cart in the upper right corner of Mahabis' site reminds visitors to complete their purchase. It's always visible, and its bright red circle is eye-catching.‍In addition to the content of your menu, optimize its configuration. A hamburger menu is fine on mobile, but avoid it on desktop. Keep menu placement standard. On desktop, horizontal at the top of the page is what shoppers are used to, although a menu to the left of the page is also recognizable. Label everything in your menu clearly.Remember: These are the things you should be looking for when you’re browsing themes. Make sure the theme you choose has options for optimized menus and pages.Group products by category on product listing pagesHelp customers find and discover products by creating product listing pages for different categories. These can be linked to from the categories in your menu.Product listing pages introduce customers to items related to what they’re interested in, and they’re good for SEO too. Individual product pages won’t usually rank for broad search engine queries, but product listing pages might. Burga's Watermelon Shake MacBook Case doesn't rank for the search term "buy MacBook case" on Google. But their product listing page for MacBook cases does.‍Tip: A discoverability-related plugin worth looking into is LimeSpot Personalizer, which recommends and upsells products and has audience segmentation features.Tactic 2: Make checkout frictionless to reduce cart abandonmentAs we mentioned at the start of this playbook, cart abandonment is a major problem. A pre-pandemic survey underscored that you’re not just losing a few sales: 55% of respondents said they wouldn’t return to an ecommerce site at all after abandoning a cart there. Here are the top five reasons for cart abandonment, according to a study:Extra costs—often shipping rates—are too highMandatory account creationSlow deliveryLong or complicated checkout processDidn’t trust the site with their credit card informationThe takeaway: Keep your checkout process as short, flexible, and transparent as possible. Some ways to do that:Offer free shipping. For most Shopify brands, free shipping is relatively easy to offer. If you’re selling extremely low-cost products and free shipping isn’t an option for all orders, set a reasonable dollar amount to qualify. To promote your brand’s free shipping incentive, you can add a bar to the top of your site, like the one offered through Free Shipping Bar by Hextom.Don’t charge customers extra fees. Bake any extra fees, like shipping costs, into your product pricing. If you’re required to charge fees—e.g., you’re shipping internationally and the customer has to pay VAT—include them on your product page, not your checkout page.Make account creation optional. Offer guest checkout with an email (and, if you truly need it, a phone number). As the UX experts at Nielsen Norman Group put it, “The higher the interaction cost, the fewer people will complete a process. This is true for any user interface steps, but in the case of e-commerce checkout there’s a particularly direct connection between user hassle and lost sales.”Use one-click checkout tools to further eliminate checkout friction. Tools like Fast and Bolt can help you implement this. Shopify has their own system too.Let people pay how they want. Allowing customers to pay through PayPal is a start. You can also configure gateways like Affirm and Klarna to offer flexible plans for customers. If you’re using Shopify Payments, you can enable Shop Pay for a quick checkout process. Some brands accept payment in Bitcoin or Ethereum.If customers do abandon cart, send them an email about the products that are waiting for them, with a link to their cart. You can set up an abandoned cart email flow to trigger automatically once people leave items in their cart for a set amount of time.The MoMA Design Store emails you if you haven’t completed a purchase.Tactic 3: Speed up your siteSite speed is one of the biggest friction points for visitors. A page that takes six seconds to load on mobile has a 106% higher chance of a bounce than one that takes a second to load. Even a small jump from one to three seconds increases bounce probability by more than 30%.What’s your site speed? The easiest way to check site speed is to use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool. It’ll tell you whether your site passes Google’s Core Web Vitals assessment, and it will give you recommendations on what to improve.Don’t panic if your score isn’t high. Google’s rating system is harsh, and the vast majority of ecommerce sites don’t pass the Core Web Vitals assessment. As shown above, Apple doesn’t even pass. But knowing what your baseline is will help you keep tabs on how much you’re improving it.How can you speed up your site? Here are five ways to improve site speed.Go page by page, instead of trying a comprehensive “hack” or plugin. Improving site speed is much easier when you break it down into discrete units.Trim the fat. The most effective way to improve load speed is to simply load fewer things. Are there images or sections you can cut? Optimizing an image may save you a few milliseconds of load time; eliminating that image entirely will save you much more. Use a heatmap like Hotjar to see what content users are interacting with, and what can be removed.Resize images. Check that any images you keep aren’t making your site sluggish. When resizing, use the WebP image format. It’s Google’s preferred format, but it’s only recently been accepted on all browsers, and your competitors might not be using it. Like jpgs, WebP will give you a small image file, but it has a higher compression quality.Don’t use more scripts and plugins than you need. In general, the more custom code you write and the more plugins you add, the slower your site will be. A minimalist approach is usually a better one. If you’re not sure whether a plugin’s benefits outweigh its site speed reduction, install it, run a speed test, and check to see if there’s a noticeable difference.Implement lazy loading. Also known as asynchronous loading, lazy loading lets ecommerce brands have full, detailed pages without compromising site speed. It works by only loading elements on a page when a user starts to scroll over them. If done right, the experience will be seamless, and users won’t notice any difference.Shopify retention marketingThere are two reasons to market your online store: to acquire and retain. Acquisition turns shoppers into customers. And retention increases repeat purchases from those customers.We don’t cover acquisition in this playbook, since our focus here is on on-site CRO and down-funnel strategies that are closer to the point of purchase. We’ll just briefly touch on Shopify’s integrations with various acquisition channels, before turning to post-purchase retention.If you want to learn how to acquire customers, you can sign up for our Growth Newsletter. We’ll send you top tactics and insights to inform your acquisition strategy.To expand top-of-funnel reach, use Shopify’s channel integrationsOne of the nice things about Shopify is how smoothly it integrates with various organic, ad, and sales channels. As a few examples, you can:Sync your product catalog to Facebook and Instagram.Embed an Instagram feed on your site—a great way to share UGC. (You can also use Archive to automatically save UGC you’re tagged in on Instagram, so you can use it on your Shopify store or post it to your Instagram feed.)Create a Google Smart Shopping campaign.Manage Amazon listings (SMBs often use Shopify and Amazon as complements, instead of only selling through one or the other).Tag your products on TikTok.Again, we won’t dive deep on these here, but as you pick acquisition channels, consider how these integrations would affect the buyer experience and likelihood of conversion. A smooth integration means an easy purchase—which could increase intent to buy. Use post-purchase messaging to keep customers engagedIt can cost about five times more to acquire a customer than retain one, yet companies often dedicate more resources to acquisition than retention.Think of the following steps as another type of CRO: customer retention optimization. Both it and conversion rate optimization bring in more sales and revenue.Once you’ve converted a customer, bring them back for repeat purchases with email engagement.Email marketingSet up an email automation flow to reach your subscribers and buyers. There are many ways to do this—here’s an example:Email 1: A welcome and thanks for subscribing. You can include a discount code here, if applicable. Keep the content fresh—for example, if a holiday is coming up, mention a sale you’re running.Email 2: Brand-focused message. Let customers know what makes your brand unique. You can include a brand story here too. This typically goes out a day or two after the first email.Email 3: Social proof and products. At this point, you can start to encourage sales by featuring popular products and listing some reviews or testimonials.Email 4: Bring people into your community. Create a warm feeling around your product. Invite recipients to follow you on Instagram, join your Facebook group, or otherwise engage with your brand.In addition to an automation flow, you can use email to promote limited-time specials or holiday deals, re-engage customers you haven’t heard from in a while (called a win-back campaign), and keep your brand front of mind.Credit: Shopify. This Graph shows conversion rates during Black Friday Cyber Monday.Most ecommerce sites that prioritize email marketing use a platform like Klaviyo or Mailchimp. There’s less of a downside (other than budget) to purchasing off-site plugins, as they won’t affect speed or visitors’ on-site experience. Email marketing is a massive, complex topic, and doing it right requires careful timing, personalization, testing, and segmentation based on demographics and products purchased. While we can’t cover everything email-related in this playbook, here are a few quick tips for creating compelling emails:Keep your subject line under 50 characters to make it readable on mobile.Include plenty of negative space and large-ish typography.Be aggressively concise in the body of your email. Don’t waste subscribers’ time with unwarranted fluff.Focus on one goal per email. More is distracting. If your goal is to promote a Black Friday discount, don’t veer off into sharing an unrelated blog article. It’s okay to have multiple CTAs in ecommerce emails, and it’s even okay to have different ones, but only if they share the same goal. (For instance, if you want readers to check out a product line, you might have dedicated CTAs for different products or categories, like “shop men’s” and “shop women’s.”)The main takeaway from this abbreviated introduction to email marketing is: If you sell on Shopify, you should be communicating directly with your audience. Third-party platforms like Instagram or Snapchat can be useful marketing tools, but nothing beats the immediate brand-to-consumer impact of email.SMS marketingYou’ll get a high open rate with SMS marketing, but does it convert? We have yet to see hard evidence that text marketing is a consistent revenue generator. Stats about high response and conversion rates tend to come from mobile marketing firms. But SMS has the potential to be a strong retention strategy. Like email capture, you can offer a popup discount in exchange for a number. Another option is to add a phone number box to your checkout page, but that’s risky—the last thing you want is to add friction toward the end of the funnel.United by Blue offers a 15% discount in exchange for a phone number.Be clear about how often you’ll be sending messages, so customers know you won’t be bombarding them.If you sign up for Mudwtr’s SMS, you get personable messages and discounts. SMS doesn’t have to be spammy.<- Previous ChapterNext Chapter ->Shopify conversions cheat sheetHere’s a quick recap of the above, with just the basic tactics and none of the strategy or granularity.Build a high-converting storeDomainsUse a custom domain. You can purchase one through your Shopify admin or a third-party domain registrar.Stick with your business name for your URL. If an exact match isn’t available, try adding a word (e.g., “get,” “shop”) or using a top-level domain other than .com.ThemesMost startups should use a premade Shopify theme. They’re built to convert and fast to launch. Exception: If you need a highly customized site, go with a custom build.Nearly 3/4s of ecommerce sales happen on mobile—bear that in mind when selecting a theme and at every stage in the shop-launch process. Use themes to research different layouts and visual displays. Use BuiltWith to see which themes your competitors use.Homepage‍Consider this formula as you craft your homepage: Conversion = desire (increase this) - labor (decrease this) - confusion (decrease this)Above the fold: Use your ATF to drive conversion-related action. Keep copy short, but make sure it conveys your unique value props. Feature product imagery (original is better than stock). Even better: Show people using your products. Use your CTA to launch customers on their on-site buyer journey. No matter what style and assets you choose for your ATF, make sure they’re mobile optimized. Below the fold: In your below the fold, expand on the information you’ve provided ATF and continue to drive conversion-related action. Depending on your brand’s buyer journey, some elements you might include are best sellers, social proof, content (blog posts, video, a brief tutorial), and info that underscores your unique product features or brand values. Include CTAs throughout.Product pages‍Most product pages look similar because they’re built for conversion. It’s okay to follow or adapt the standard product page formula: on desktop, product image at left and description at right, and on mobile, product image above description. Get creative with your assets, not your product page layout, which should draw attention to your product photos and “add to cart” CTA. Create a sensory experience to help customers reach their “aha moment.” Use high-quality images, including action shots. Write copy that connects your product’s benefits to your customers and reiterates your value props.Be transparent about your refund policy. If it makes sense for your product type (e.g., consumables), offer standard or group subscriptions.Feature related items on your product pages to encourage upsells and cross-sells. Showcase your product reviews to motivate on-the-fence shoppers. These are trustworthy social proof and a critical factor in shoppers’ decision-making process. Plugin recommendation: Yotpo.Checkout page‍A boring checkout page is better than a clever one. Your checkout page serves one purpose: move customers from product page to purchase. Keep forms as short as possible and CTAs all order-focused. Consider testing whether to add personalized recommendations to your checkout page. They could increase order value, or they could increase distraction. Plugin recommendation: Personalized Recommendations.PopupsUse a popup to offer an incentive (e.g., a discount, giveaway, free shipping, or exclusive offer) in exchange for an email address. Unlike third-party platforms, your email list is something you own, so it’s a crucial part of growth marketing. If you gate free shipping behind an email form, you’ll grow your email list, but you might alienate customers who expect free shipping as a given. Gate free shipping if it’s more important for your startup to grow its email list than get fast conversions.Use the 60% Rule to time popups. Set a popup to appear after 60% of the average time spent on a page. Align your popups to your customer journey, for instance by triggering them only after a product page visit. And use them sparingly—max once per session.Urgency‍Create a sense of urgency by displaying limited stock levels or adding a countdown. Use time-oriented CTAs like “shop now” or “subscribe today.”Live chat‍Offer live chat to increase order value and improve the customer experience. Recommended tools: Intercom, Olark, and Drift.A/B testing‍Use A/B testing to optimize your Shopify website’s conversion rate through micro and macro changes. Use Google Optimize while you’re launching your testing program. Later, consider more feature-rich software like Optimizely.Optimize the on-site customer journeyMenu‍Include product categories in your menu, ordered by popularity and grouped if there are a lot of them. Don’t include anything in your menu that doesn’t help with conversion. For some brands—typically those with a relatively low AOV or that don’t sell highly specialized or complex products—that means moving the About Us page, blog, and informational pages out of the menu.Add your shopping cart to your nav. Consider making it “sticky,” so it’s always visible.Don’t use a hamburger menu on desktop, and don’t get creative with menu placement. Top of page on desktop is what users are accustomed to.Product listing pages‍Group products by category on product listing pages. These help with discoverability and SEO rankings. Recommended plugin for upselling: LimeSpot Personalizer.Checkout process‍Reduce cart abandonment by addressing friction points during checkout.Offer free shipping on all products if possible, or most products otherwise. Recommended tool: Free Shipping Bar by Hextom.Don’t charge extra fees. Include them in your product price or on your product page, not your checkout page.Make account creation optional, not mandatory.Use one-click checkout tools. Recommended tools: Fast and Bolt.Give customers multiple ways to pay—they’ll appreciate the flexibility. Recommended tools: PayPal, Affirm, Klarna, and Shop Pay.Set up an abandoned cart email flow.  When people leave items in their cart for a set amount of time, they’ll get an email with a link back to their cart.Site speed‍Use Google’s PageSpeed Insights to check your site speed, then improve it page by page. Remove any excess content, scripts, and plugins. Use a heatmap tool like Hotjar to see what can be cut, and compare site speed before and after a plugin installation to see how much it slows things down.Optimize images by resizing and using the WebP image format.Try lazy loading, so elements only load when they’re going to be viewed.Shopify retention marketingAcquisition‍Acquisition turns shoppers into customers.Take advantage of Shopify’s integrations with different ad/sales and organic channels, including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Amazon, and TikTok. E.g., you can embed an Instagram feed on your Shopify store to promote UGC. Recommended tool: Archive.Retention‍Retention increases repeat purchases by existing customers. It’s less costly than initial acquisition.Increase retention with a post-purchase email marketing flow. Also use email marketing for brand promotions and win-back campaigns. Keep your subject lines under 50 characters, include plenty of negative space in your emails, and be as concise as possible. Focus on one goal per email. Recommended tools: Klaviyo and Mailchimp.Consider an SMS marketing campaign, but don’t prioritize SMS over email. If you do try it, be transparent about how often you’ll be sending messages.Become a better marketer, in minutes.Join the Growth Newsletter.

Privacy. Personalization.Businesses used to skate by without putting much thought into these three words. In the 2020s, that doesn’t work anymore.Data is now the lifeblood of consumer-focused businesses. And the tools that use that data are companies’ vital organs.Smart companies are using data to personalize their interactions with customers in a way that enhances their experience while also respecting their privacy. But we don’t need to tell you how important personalization is. Instead, we can simply look at Spotify Wrapped—Spotify’s annual year-in-review slideshow highlighting users’ listening stats. Since Spotify Wrapped launched in 2016, people look forward to finding out and sharing their listening stats every December.The mechanics are simple: Spotify collects user data and then uses it to create a personalized experience with curated “Top Songs” playlists and other interesting insights.It’s a big deal because:In 2019, Wrapped playlists earned almost 3 billion streams. And roughly 1.2 million tweets mentioned the campaign within its first month of launching. In 2020, the campaign increased Spotify’s downloads by 21% in the first week of December.The takeaway here: Personalization leads to engagement, and engagement leads to growth.In fact, today’s customers expect personalization. According to a 2021 McKinsey report, 71% of consumers expect personalized experiences from companies. And when companies fail to deliver, an even larger number (76%) get frustrated.In other words, personalization is no longer a “nice-to-have”—it’s the new standard for customer experiences.Personalization and growthSpotify has millions of daily active users, engineering teams that can figure out what data to collect and how to get it, and growth and product teams that know how to use that data to grow.Most businesses don’t have these resources. But with the right setup, any business can collect and leverage data for personalization. We’ll show you how in this playbook.First, let’s define personalization. Personalization means respectfully collecting relevant user data and then using that data across different touchpoints within the marketing and sales funnel. A few examples:Last week, you browsed sweaters on Patagonia’s site. Today, you go back to the site and see tailored sweater recommendations based on the products and colors you eyed last time.You order a bag of coffee beans from your favorite coffee shop using its app. Two weeks later, as your supply is running low, the app sends a push notification with a 10% off promo code.You’re having trouble accessing a feature on the SaaS tool you use for work. Since you’re a premium-tier customer, you’re routed straight to a customer service rep and get your problem solved quickly. Besides creating a better customer experience, personalization also drives 10-15% lifts in revenue. The effect is even higher—as much as 25%—for some online companies, like DTC brands.Why does this happen? Personalization creates a flywheel effect that drives customer lifetime value (LTV) and loyalty. It amplifies marketing spend and ROI, especially when invested in for the long term.Simply put, companies that use personalization tactics win more customers and grow faster than those that don’t. Still, many companies and startups struggle with personalization, especially when it comes to more granular tactics. Unless your company has loads of data (like the Spotifys, Amazons, and Netflixes of the world), personalizing beyond basic info like someone’s name or location can feel difficult. Not to mention, companies like Apple and Google are increasingly limiting marketers’ ability to use customer data. Consumers’ (rightfully) growing privacy concerns mean that companies must work harder to be respectful and avoid coming across as creepy or intrusive.This playbook tackles all of these challenges.We’ve worked with data and personalization experts to understand how you can use customer data to improve conversions without breaking privacy laws or anyone’s trust. In other words, we’ll show you how to use personalization to grow in 2022.Specifically, we’ll cover the three key pillars of personalization:Privacy—why data governance and compliance are important, and the type of data needed for optimal personalization.What tools you can use to collect customer data, and how to maximize their value.Then on to the fun part—we’ll show you how to execute personalization tactics across different channels, including email, ads, and SMS.Let’s dive in.Privacy and data governancePrivacy should be viewed as a fundamental human right. While it might seem contradictory to advocate for privacy in a playbook about personalization, privacy and personalization actually go hand in hand. Consumers value both—think of them as two sides of the same coin.The key is personalizing data in a way that respects customer privacy. This all comes down to having a well-defined data governance strategy—the policies and rules about what type of data you collect, how you collect it, and how you manage it.Your strategy should follow these three guidelines:Collect customer information responsibly. Customers are increasingly wary of how companies collect and use their data, so you need to be transparent about it. Tell people how you do it and why.Adopt a customer-centric mindset. There’s more to data governance than simply following regulations like the GDPR and CCPA. Rather than thinking of data in terms of legal compliance, you’re better off embracing a customer-first mindset all around. Don’t overstep. Respecting your customers’ privacy will earn you trust. Break that trust and you’ll find it hard to recover.Personalization with both privacy laws and customer boundaries in mind will ultimately position your company for faster, more consistent growth.   What kind of data should my company collect?To avoid breaking the law or compromising your customers’ trust, you should collect only the data you need and use tools that manage this data responsibly. For starters, here’s a quick breakdown of the different types of customer data:First-party: Data that customers provide directly to you on your channels, like your site or app. This includes info given directly and intentionally, like forms and surveys, plus behavioral data from customer interactions like email engagement and website activity.Second-party: Another organization’s first-party data. You can buy this from another company without any middleman.Third-party: Customer data collected and managed by data aggregators that don’t directly interact with customers. They buy first-party data and combine it into one dataset that they then sell on marketplaces and exchanges.Where you get your data from is a big determiner of how reliable it is.Since first-party data comes straight from your audience, it’s the most accurate and relevant type of data for any business. And because privacy regulations like the CCPA and GDPR restrict the use of third-party data, first-party data is quickly becoming the only viable option.Not to mention, it’s often (though not always) the type of data that customers are comfortable with you having. Knowing that you’re working only with the information they’ve provided, customers will appreciate your personalization rather than feel violated.At this point, we’ve covered how personalization can drive growth, and why privacy matters. Now we’ll explain what tools can help collect and manage your data, and then execute personalization tactics to grow your business.How to collect and manage customer data qualityGreat personalization hinges on clean and accurate customer data—but data is notoriously hard to collect in a clean manner. Since many companies have data coming into their ecosystem in all sorts of ways, it’s tough to keep it standardized.Imagine trying to work with bad data:Your marketing campaigns would come off as irrelevant or out-of-date. Your analytics would be wrong. More than likely, your entire digital strategy would fail.The trouble is, without a strong infrastructure in place, the actual data collection process can quickly lead to “data chaos”:Different departments like product, marketing, and customer support might collect the same data in different ways without sharing it. So you wind up with data silos—separate, inconsistent collections of information.On the customer side, users toggle between logged in and logged out states, anonymous and known. They might even engage across multiple devices.The thing about data is that it creates compounding effects over time. So while high-quality data improves performance, poor data quality increasingly degrades it.So if your data quality isn’t improving, it’s degrading. The good news? There are tools that can help you manage your customer data. Using these, you can deliver personalized experiences that resonate with your users—without violating their privacy.CDPs as a foundation for personalizationCustomer data platforms (CDPs) collect and consolidate customer data from a variety of sources like websites and mobile apps in real time. They create and update customer profiles that can power marketing and analytics tools instantly. By collectively using customer data across all of your tools rather than relying on a series of one-off integrations, a CDP can be the source of truth when it comes to customer data.Note that a CDP isn’t the same as customer relationship management (CRM) software like Salesforce or HubSpot. Here’s how they differ:CDPs unify fast-moving data from different online and offline channels, devices, and software tools to create complex profiles of individual customers. They can identify people you’d otherwise have very scattered information about, or who you might think of as separate users.CRMs focus primarily on collecting first-party customer data from sales and marketing. They’re often used to help salespeople (not just marketers) understand known contacts so they can deliver more customized interactions.By consolidating all your collected information in one place, CDPs help prevent data chaos.CRMs can keep your sales data organized, and they’re helpful in many marketing use cases, too. But if personalization is the goal, you can’t beat a quality CDP. That’s why we’ll focus mostly on using CDPs to not only gather data but use it for actionable insights.The best CDPs help with this by capturing clean, real-time first-party data at the source, storing it, and delivering it across tools. There's less of a need for second- or third-party data enrichment since the first-party data is clean, organized, and centralized.But not all CDPs are privacy-forward. We’ll help you make sense of this.Should my company invest in a CDP?A CDP helps capture quality, real-time data on your site and mobile apps, plus data from other partners and vendors—like your email marketing platform and your analytics tools. So you can easily see how different personas and audience segments are interacting with your business. It’s a must for any company that wants to build and maintain a relationship with customers over time.Most companies we’ve helped grow fall into one of three stages when it comes to data strategy:Beginner: Startups that lack a formal first-party data strategy. At this stage, companies should consider an analytics tool like Indicative to measure usage and create unified customer journeys.Informed: Startups in the process of creating a holistic data strategy. There’s clear direction, leadership is thinking about standardizing data, and there are dedicated team members working on data management. Companies at this stage acknowledge the challenges around data and want to execute it better. Advanced: Startups that have a full-blown data strategy and are already running a high volume of quality experiments. Companies at this stage are almost definitely already using a CDP.What stage your company is at depends on the tools and processes involved in your data collection—and whether you have a coherent strategy in place.If your company is moving into or already at the informed or advanced stages, you’ll benefit from having a CDP. But which one should you use?There are a handful of CDPs on the market, but we recommend mParticle.There’s a common misconception that setting up a CDP is complicated—but that’s not the case with mParticle. Installation is simple: it involves a single API for tracking customer data so you don’t need to swap out code again and again. All you need to get started is a simple data strategy that answers the following questions:Goals: What business outcomes are you trying to achieve?KPIs: What KPIs map to these goals?Tools: What tools will you use to accomplish these goals?Data: What data needs to be collected to power these tools?Segmentation: How do you want to use customer segmentation and what data needs to be collected to segment successfully?While some CDPs only store and process data, mParticle enables you to automate complex marketing processes using rules and conditional logic. What’s more, mParticle takes care of privacy with its data collection and identity resolution processes. Because it records all opt-ins and opt-outs, plus other contact points and preferences, you’ll never hit someone with an unwanted piece of messaging. So you’ll spend far less time managing privacy regulations.Let’s say you run an ecommerce company. Your main goal is to increase conversions, so you plan an email campaign for users who’ve performed a specific set of activities like adding products to their cart.You use your email marketing tool to create and execute the campaign, looking at email marketing KPIs like click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate to track its results. Depending on which (if any) link your subscribers click in the first email you send, you’ll segment them to personalize the email flow they’ll get.Pretty straightforward campaign, right?Here’s the catch. Without a CDP, you’d run this campaign directly in your email marketing tool. But all of the data you collect would be stuck in your email tool—you wouldn’t be able to use it across the rest of your marketing stack. Most of the data would go to waste.But with a CDP, you’d collect the relevant data from the campaign and send it to all of your other systems—your analytics tool, business intelligence system, and data warehouse. You’d have a real-time profile for each of the subscribers in your campaign. And you could easily share customer insights with other tools like Google Analytics and Intercom.CDP-compatible marketing and measurement toolsCDPs collect and streamline first-party data from all the other tools in your marketing stack so you don’t have to deal with scattered pieces of info. Here are some popular platforms that we recommend and that commonly integrate with CDPs.

Personalization tactics—how to use customer dataHow your customer data is managed ultimately determines your business’s personalization opportunities. So for more effective personalization, you simply need a CDP like mParticle and a marketing tools stack to support it.Now we’ll dig into the next step: Using your collected data to personalize your marketing.As you think through personalization, consider these three important questions:What data do I currently have?What data can I get?Where can this data be applied?The rest of this playbook covers tactics you can use to ethically leverage customer data and create a personalized experience for more conversions. We say ethically because all of these tactics index on using a privacy-forward CDP to execute.Below, we’ve categorized different tactics based on channel—but this actually brings us to our first personalization tip. Use customer data to prioritize which channels and touchpoints to focus on.Different personas have unique preferences for how they engage with brands, and CDPs can capture these preferences. So look at the channels your top customers and other segments use most. If your top customers engage more with your emails than via SMS, prioritize email personalization.Here are the different channels we cover:WebsiteEmailAdsIn-app messaging and SMSCustomer supportWebsiteCustomize on-site search resultsBest for: Ecommerce brandsHow it works: If you’ve ever collected customers’ demographic information (whether from email surveys, user profiles, or something else), you can easily use it to personalize users’ search results on your site. This way, shoppers can find what they’re looking for even faster.Example: Because of its running and training apps, Nike has both demographic info and workout data about its customers. The Nike Run Club App collects first-party data like gender and shoe size, and also lets users choose whether Nike can use their workout info.So if a woman who uses the Nike Run Club app searches “shoes” on Nike’s website, the results could return women’s road running shoes rather than men’s shoes or shoes for another activity.Without personalization, searching "shoes" on Nike's site returns results for a variety of shoes for different ages, genders, and sports.With a personalized search experience, users see results that they're more likely to be interested in.Personalized search results make for a better shopping experience—people don’t have to scroll through irrelevant products to find what they want. And if they’d rather not, they can always opt out of these targeted product recommendations on Nike’s app or website.Show in-stock merchandise based on customers’ preferencesBest for: Ecommerce brandsHow it works: By looking at purchase history, CDPs can capture granular info about customers’ shopping preferences, like their most frequently purchased sizes. Using this data, you can personalize how products are shown. For instance, you could arrange the order of your products based on customer interest or make it so that only in-stock products that match a customer’s size (or another preference) appear. This shortens the typical buyer’s journey because customers won’t spend time browsing all of your items. Instead, they’ll only see those that are in stock and most relevant to them.Example: A sports equipment retailer like Academy Sports + Outdoors could create and implement a point system—using a CDP—to understand which sport (or category of products) shoppers are most interested in. Using this system, a purchase would count as a point toward a specific sport. So a customer’s shopping history could generate data output like this:Tennis: 5Cycling: 3Volleyball: 1Golf: 0Academy could use this data to personalize the order of products shown on its site, placing tennis equipment ahead of golf equipment. It could also remove from display any currently unavailable products that match the customer’s interests so that customers only see the in-stock options at hand.The result: less friction for shoppers since out-of-stock products and products they’re not interested in are automatically removed from display. And with a smaller chance of being overwhelmed by decision fatigue, shoppers may be more likely to convert into repeat customers.Upsell and cross-sell only to high-AOV customersBest for: B2C companies and any company where repeat customers are possible, e.g., ecommerce shops, food delivery appsHow it works: Average order value (AOV) is a strong indicator of how much a customer is willing to spend on an order. So if a customer has a consistent history of ordering above a certain threshold, you could automate upsell and cross-sell offers on the checkout page whenever their current order is below that amount. Example: The meal delivery company HelloFresh could categorize recurring customers based on AOV, with those spending an average of $150 labeled as high-AOV customers. Whenever returning customers are about to check out with a smaller order, HelloFresh’s site could automatically upsell them with gourmet protein options or add-ons like sides and desserts.This kind of personalization wins for two reasons:You’ll drive more revenue from a proven source—your high-value customers. You’ll create a better shopping experience for customers with a lower AOV. This personalization avoids futile cross-selling or upselling attempts with these customers.Give product fit recommendationsBest for: Ecommerce brands, especially apparel companiesHow it works: Online-only apparel companies often face more issues with incorrect sizing than their brick-and-mortar counterparts. While size charts and quizzes help customers get a better idea of fit, they often don’t account for differences in wearing preferences. Some customers prefer loose-fitting clothing while others prefer slim fit. In this case, two customers of the same proportions might choose different sizes for comfort.To reduce return rates, companies can use customer data to find out their wearing preferences and give tailored recommendations. For instance, it can specify on its product pages how true to size products are and give personalized messages like “Buy one size up for a more relaxed fit.”Example: When shoppers create a user profile for the apparel brand Lulu’s, they have the option to enter fit details like their body type and measurements.Users can provide their complete body measurements on Lulu's website.Combined with their purchase history and size chart, Lulu’s can better understand shoppers’ fit preferences. So as customers browse its product pages, a popup might appear to suggest, “Even if you usually buy M, we’ve found this fit to look great in one size up.”How does this level of personalization benefit growth? It reduces the likelihood of returns, especially among “serial returners” who buy multiple sizes of the same product to identify their best fit. Over time, customers might even develop greater trust in a company’s products and sizing suggestions.EmailSend hyperspecific email offers based on buying patternsBest for: All companiesHow it works: One of the most useful functions of a CDP is to consolidate data from all of your marketing tools in a centralized location. This way, you can easily see comprehensive customer profiles instead of trying to put together scattered info from separate marketing and analytics tools. You can then use these complete profiles to create more targeted email offers to granular slices of your audience—like segments based on customers’ purchase frequency and time of purchase.Example: Apart from different levels of enthusiasm, fans of professional sports teams come from all kinds of backgrounds—location, age, income, etc. But without a CDP, it’s hard for teams to manage or even collect customer data since customers bounce between team websites and ticket marketplaces like Ticketmaster.Using a CDP, marketers for a specific sports team can identify individual fans’ preferences for attending games. This way, they can create and send hyperspecific email offers. For example:One-time ticket buyers receive promotional deals that don’t apply to season ticket holders, like free drink specials.Fans with a history of buying tickets for weekend games only receive offers for weekend games. Male fans receive emails about “Guys Night Out” while female fans receive emails about “Ladies Night Out” deals.A CDP can help sports teams advertise more enticing promotions to fans based on their preferences.Consolidating your data and then using it to segment your audience ultimately reduces the likelihood of sending redundant or irrelevant offers. And since people will find value in your emails, they’ll actually open and read them, rather than ignoring them or unsubscribing. You’ll see more conversions as well as improved email campaign results. Tailor and send messages based on company size and user roleBest for: B2B companies, companies that serve different tiers of customers, products with a variety of use casesHow it works: Not all customers find value from your product in the same way. Because of this, a general onboarding email sequence may be ineffective in showing users how to get the most from it.This is especially common among B2B software companies that serve different industries—consider how educators, software developers, and finance professionals all use Zoom. In cases like this, info like company size and a user’s job title can be used to create and send more targeted content. Example: During the signup process, a software company could ask new users for information like the size of their company and their department. For instance, the project management software Clickup asks users how many people they’ll be working with.Asking this question helps Clickup understand what new users might be looking for from its platform.The company could then send tailored messaging based on this info, plus additional user behavior that gives clues on what users are looking for. In Clickup’s case, here’s how that might look:For people who indicate that they’re working alone, ClickUp could send emails with resources like ClickUp for Freelancers. People working in teams, on the other hand, might receive emails with collaboration tips, like ClickUp’s Teams: How to Create User Groups article.ClickUp could automatically enroll new users in email workflows based on their job role, with different sequences for recruiters, product managers, software developers, etc.Specific actions could trigger even more targeted emails. For instance, as product managers explore different task features, ClickUp could automate a message about creating work sprints for product management.Targeted content that caters to a user’s role and their purpose for using your product helps to maximize their experience with it. They’ll be more likely to stick around, unlike users who miss out on important features because they’re not applicable to every audience. And besides retention, an improved user experience can even drive more referrals—satisfied customers will be happy to share your product with friends and colleagues with similar needs.AdsMatch your retargeting ads to the content users visitBest for: Companies that invest in content marketingHow it works: Whether it’s SEO or virality, many businesses invest in content to drive website traffic and improve overall awareness of their brand. Depending on the number of unique personas your company serves, you can use customer insights from your content to enhance your retargeting campaigns. Specifically, you can create retargeting ads that match and complement the content that users visit, and then only target those users. So you won’t just have one mass retargeting campaign that tries appealing to everyone who’s ever visited your site—instead, you’d have targeted ads for each unique visitor segment.  Example: The SEO content strategy for a B2C company that sells supplements for joint pain might involve creating blog posts targeting different customer personas based on sport. For instance, there might be separate posts about joint pain for weightlifters, golfers, and runners. The idea here is to attract a wide variety of visitors suffering from joint pain using niche content.Using insights from traffic analytics, the same company could create separate ads for each persona and then retarget users based on the blog posts they visited. So someone who read a blog post about knee pain while golfing might only see ads specifically about joint pain in the context of golfing—like the ad on the right below. For someone who plays golf and suffers from joint pain, the ad on the right feels more appealing because it speaks to their specific situation.This is far more effective than a generic, catch-all retargeting ad like the one on the left. After all, each of your customer personas has unique needs. By speaking to their individual preferences, personalized retargeting can help drive more conversions. Test a wider variety of retargeting ads for lapsed customersBest for: All companiesHow it works: Not all inactive customers are unsatisfied with your company. Research suggests some lapsed customers may love and even identify as being loyal to your brand, but shop elsewhere because of convenience, budget, or other reasons.Because of this, a “We miss you!” ad with a discount may not be enough to reactivate them. Beyond customers’ order count or last date of purchase, your retargeting ads should also consider additional data points that factor into a customer’s decision to buy from your business again. This could be location or type of product, for instance. While it’s difficult to pinpoint a customer’s exact reason for lapsing, CDPs make it easy to create detailed audience segments and test retargeting ads more efficiently.Example: A local business might have lapsed customers because of physical distance—either because their customers have moved or they simply don’t want to drive so far when closer alternatives are available. It may even be that when they do make the trek and shop there, it’s crowded or the lines are long.In this case, it’s worth testing several retargeting strategies based on your customers’ location. For instance, you could retarget customers within your region with ads that:Emphasize low shipping fees or free delivery within a certain mile radius Promote local pop-ups in the same city as your customerOffer curbside pickup as a more convenient way of shoppingDoing so can help shed light on why different customers lapsed—and what offers might compel them to return. You’ll also be able to gather more customer insights on the value props that speak to your audience, which you can then use to optimize your business’s messaging.Create and update complex negative audiences instantaneouslyBest for: All companiesHow it works: To get a better return on ad spend (ROAS), marketers often create negative audiences for their ad campaigns. Negative audiences are groups of people you don’t want your ads to reach, whether because they’ve already bought something from you or they simply don’t belong in your target demographic. You can create and upload negative audiences without a CDP. But the challenge with them is that you need to regularly update them; otherwise, your suppression lists quickly become outdated. CDPs can automate this—and also create more complex negative audiences because they consolidate data from more sources, like the rest of your marketing tools.Example: To develop traction, a photo-sharing app like FamilyAlbum might set a goal for increasing user downloads and run ads on Facebook and Instagram.FamilyAlbum runs prospecting ads on Facebook and Instagram to reach more users.Since it would be redundant to show ads to users that already have the app, FamilyAlbum could create a negative audience made up of registered users. This way, users that have already downloaded the app and created an account won’t see any of its ads on social media. Using negative audiences means not only delivering more relevant messaging to your target audience but also doing so cost-effectively. In the example above, you’ll save money by excluding people who’ve already downloaded and registered for your app.In-app messaging and SMSRequest product reviews and referrals from engaged users at the right timeBest for: All companiesHow it works: When asking for a product review, marketers often rely on the passage of time to determine when to make their request. For instance, they wait two weeks after purchase to ask for a review—regardless of whether the customer has actually used the product.In reality, to get positive reviews, both user engagement and timing are critical. Rather than blasting all customers with a message asking for a review, you can automate these requests based on how engaged customers are and when they interact with your business. Combining these data points will get better results than if you were to only use one. Here are different data points you could use to trigger your requests:Engagement: Specific page views; video views; social media likes; minutes spent on an app; number of app sessionsTiming: Completion of a certain action in your app (e.g., reaching the next level of a game); after a high-value order has been fulfilled; after your customer renews for another billing cycleThe same strategy can also be applied to asking for referrals. By catching engaged users at a moment when your business is top of mind, they’ll be more likely to actually share it with a friend. Example: The language learning app Duolingo could look at product usage to determine which customers to ask for reviews or referrals. It could trigger a request for users who have used the app for 10 consecutive days, and it could even time this request for after the user has completed a daily language exercise. DuoLingo's streak calendar tracks how many consecutive days users engage with its app.After all, it wouldn’t make sense to interrupt users in the middle of a learning session or to reach out to those who barely use the app. By targeting users based on both engagement and timing, you’ll reach customers who have a strong rapport with your company and are in the right frame of mind to give a positive review or refer a friend. Notify traveling customers about locations in their destination cityBest for: Businesses with brick-and-mortar locations in different citiesHow it works: Use geolocation data from sources like Foursquare to find out where customers are traveling. If they travel to a city where your business has a location, send a text or push notification encouraging them to visit. Alternatively, entice them to visit with local discounts and promotions.Example: The salon chain Drybar uses the tool Radar to detect when customers are traveling. Traveling to an area where Drybar has a location triggers a push notification asking if customers want to book an appointment for a blowout. If customers travel to another city with a Drybar location, Drybar sends a push notification encouranging them to make an appointment.Drybar shares that not only did these push notifications increase its full-price bookings by nearly 3x, but they amplified brand awareness. So customers who weren’t already aware that their destination city had a Drybar location learned about the new location and could make plans to visit.Besides simply driving more conversions and improving brand awareness, this kind of personalization could potentially grow customer loyalty. Imagine a business professional who travels frequently—either to a new place or the same city—and wants consistency in her haircare. Since people prefer familiar brands, these push notifications make a great case for going to Drybar both at home and when traveling.Target users struggling to make progressBest for: Mobile app companies, especially those that drive revenue through in-app purchases (e.g., games and dating apps)How it works: When users struggle with an app, chances are they’ll get discouraged and stop using it. After all, no one wants to continue using an app when it doesn’t feel like it’s working or that they’re not good at it. This struggle is an opportunity to provide personalized support—helpful tips, links to resources, or even a discount on a helpful upgrade to make things easier.  The exact details depend on your app, but you can automate this content based on event triggers like the number of games lost or total matched connections. Providing personalized support helps to retain users for longer, and in the case of offering discounts on premium features, can also increase in-app purchases.Example: On the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, users can buy “beans,” its in-app currency, to unlock special features. For example, users can spend their beans on "Priority Likes" to get more potential matches.To identify struggling users, Coffee Meets Bagel could calculate the number of matches each of its users receives, and then compare it against the average number of matches across all users. It could then deliver personalized content to the users receiving a relatively low number of matches, like:Give tips on how to improve their profile (“People tend to get X% more matches when they upload more than one photo!”)Offer a discount on beans to get a better app experience (“Want to unlock more Priority Likes? Get 20% off our beans”)Providing support to struggling users ultimately motivates them to stay, and by doing so, reduces customer churn. Customer supportPrioritize high-value customersBest for: Companies that serve different tiers of customersHow it works: Companies with freemium or tiered business models may struggle with prioritizing customer support requests. But with consolidated user data and ID recognition, you can automatically prioritize high-value customers. For instance, on your site, you could default to using AI chatbots for self-serve customers while immediately directing enterprise clients to live agents. Example: Unexpected cancellations and delays can lead to a lot of customer phone calls—more than an airline company’s support team can handle. But, with a CDP that recognizes customer phone numbers, agents could automatically prioritize calls from first-class customers. This doesn’t mean economy travelers would have to wait endlessly for in-person support, though. The airline company could instead connect these customers with AI-powered callbots as an immediate solution, and route them to agents as they become available.In this way, personalization helps to triage customer support, placing high-value customers first so that you can retain their business for longer.  Route customers to the most efficient solution—and deliver better serviceBest for: All companiesHow it works: A single customer may reach out to a company for support in a variety of ways—by email, phone, chatbot, and online contact forms, to name a few. CDPs can consolidate this activity in a single user profile, making it easier to understand the wider context of a specific customer’s product use or needs. This way, support can be delivered faster and more efficiently, without having to ask the customer to repeat themself.Without personalization, users must interact with chatbots for longer before they can reach their desired solution.This not only sheds light on where exactly a customer is struggling, but also which customers need more support. For instance, a customer who’s submitted multiple helpdesk tickets and emailed support in the past month probably needs more help than a customer creating their first ticket over the last year. Feeding this info to your support team helps them both prioritize users and deliver more tailored responses. Example: Looking at data about customer support requests, a SaaS company like Shopify might notice two distinct audience segments: tech-savvy users and users with basic computer literacy. The tech-savvy customers tend to ask more nuanced questions about software capabilities while the other users ask about common features already covered on your site.Here are a few ideas for delivering better customer service based on these observations:Whenever a tech-savvy user contacts a chatbot, connect them with a live support agent. Their questions will probably be more complex than a chatbot can handle, and a support agent can intervene to prevent them from getting frustrated.For users with basic computer literacy, automate an email that links to helpful resources, like tutorials and FAQs. Flag customers with frequent support requests so that once a minimum of support interactions is reached, someone from your support team will reach out to offer a guided training session.Some users will struggle with your product more than others, and they’ll probably seek support in different ways. A CDP helps to combine these separate streams of data so you can deliver support faster and more effectively. By enhancing your support, you’ll preempt further frustrations and improve the overall product experience—meaning greater customer satisfaction and loyalty in the long run.ConclusionCompanies that collect customer data without leveraging it are missing out on the benefits of personalization—that is, faster growth and more conversions.But delivering personalized experiences comes with two big hurdles: data quality and privacy concerns. Without a solution for either, you’ll quickly lose customers. Fortunately, a robust CDP like mParticle can help you execute a sharper personalization strategy with privacy at the forefront rather than as an afterthought. By focusing on data quality, governance, and connectivity, CDPs help teams to execute a privacy-safe personalization strategy across multiple channels—helping you not only build but also sustain quality customer relationships for the long run.Our CDP of choiceThe team at mParticle provided top personalization insights for this playbook.

# GROWTH GUIDES

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth

---

## 1. Introduction to Growth

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/intro

### Core Definition

Growth represents the convergence of marketing, sales, and product functions. Rather than siloed departments, growth eliminates barriers between these areas to collectively address company bottlenecks and establish scalable systems.

### Key Principles

**Cross-Disciplinary Focus:**
- Attracting qualified prospects
- Improving sales conversion
- Enhancing product satisfaction

The framework emphasizes founder-level responsibility—only leadership can embed growth principles throughout an organization.

### Guide Learning Path

The comprehensive curriculum covers eight modules:

1. **Competitive Analysis** - De-risk strategy through competitor audits
2. **Landing Pages** - Convert visitors via persuasive messaging
3. **Ad Creation** - Craft social media campaigns effectively
4. **Onboarding** - Reduce user churn post-acquisition
5. **Ad Operations** - Scale paid channels
6. **Content Marketing** - Build authority and organic leads
7. **Testing** - Systematically improve conversion rates
8. **Strategic Next Steps** - Advanced growth tactics

---

## 2. Competitive Analysis

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/competitive-analysis

### Core Purpose
Competitive analysis de-risks growth experiments by identifying best practices to adopt and tactics to avoid from established companies.

### Key Selection Criteria

**Choose competitors wisely:** Focus on sustained, high-growth companies (Pinterest, Airbnb, Amazon) rather than early-stage startups, which may succeed through hidden factors unrelated to their visible tactics.

**Match on two dimensions:**
- Similar audience demographics and behaviors
- Identical business model (e.g., freemium SaaS, high-touch sales, mobile games)

### Main Tactics to Analyze

#### 1. A/B Testing Discovery
Use incognito browsing to bypass cookie-based bucketing and see multiple variants. Screenshot variations and reverse-engineer hypotheses about value propositions, imagery, social proof, or pricing approaches being tested.

#### 2. Landing Page Research
Access sitemaps via `sitemap.xml` to find unlisted ad landing pages. Use Ahrefs or SEMrush to identify pages receiving paid search traffic. Landing pages reveal segmentation by audience and value proposition.

#### 3. Paid Advertising
- **Facebook/Instagram:** Search the Facebook Ads Library; observe high-engagement retargeting ads for signals of effectiveness
- **Google Ads:** Use Ahrefs to identify keywords, click costs, and spending patterns
- **Trends:** Monitor Google Trends and Similar Web for awareness trajectory signals

#### 4. Content Marketing
Cross-reference high-volume keywords (via Ahrefs) with social engagement metrics (via BuzzSumo) to identify resonant topics worth covering.

#### 5. Onboarding Audit
Sign up for newsletters, free trials, and products. Document every outreach touchpoint: emails, ads, sales contact. Use Built With to identify their tech stack and tools.

### Implementation Process
Source ideas → prioritize → A/B test → measure → implement only winners. Never blindly copy; test assumptions relevant to your specific context.

---

## 3. Landing Pages

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/landing-pages

### Core Framework

**Purchase Rate Formula**: Desire - (Labor + Confusion) = Purchase Rate

To optimize conversions, increase desire while decreasing labor and confusion.

### Standard Landing Page Structure

1. **Navbar** - Logo and navigation links
2. **Hero** - Header, subheader, and imagery
3. **Social proof** - Press logos or customer brands
4. **Call-to-action** - Signup button with incentive
5. **Features and objections** - Value propositions addressed
6. **Repeat CTA**
7. **Footer** - Miscellaneous links

### Hero Section - Header Writing
- Must be fully descriptive of what you're selling
- Test: Would readers understand your product from the header alone?
- Avoid vague corporate language ("Improve workflow!")
- Use specific benefits ("Groceries delivered in 1 hour")

### Adding Hooks to Headers
Two approaches:
1. **Bold, specific claims** - Create curiosity about how benefits are possible
2. **Address objections** - Proactively handle major buying concerns

### Subheader Strategy
Expand on two elements:
1. How the product works exactly
2. Which features support the header's claim

Keep to one or two sentences maximum.

### Social Proof Section
Display logos of press coverage or recognizable customers to create FOMO and establish credibility. If lacking notable customers, offer free access to employees at well-known companies.

### Features and Objections Section
Each feature includes:
- Short value proposition header
- Paragraph explaining the feature and addressing key objections
- Image demonstrating the product in action

### CTA Best Practices
- CTAs should feel like natural continuations of your hero narrative
- Use action-oriented language connecting to the initial promise
- Avoid generic phrases like "Request a meeting"

### Feedback and Validation

When reviewing landing pages, gather feedback on:
1. **Conversion readiness** - Would they purchase now? What's missing?
2. **Interest sustainability** - Rate on 1-10 scale
3. **Message clarity** - What's confusing or unclear?
4. **Content expansion** - What needs more detail?
5. **Necessary brevity** - What could be cut?
6. **Credibility concerns** - What feels manipulative or false?

---

## 4. Making Ads

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/make-ads

### Core Concepts

**Ad Copy vs. Creative**
- Copy refers to text carefully crafted for specific outcomes like sales or clicks
- Creative encompasses multimedia elements such as images and videos
- Both elements significantly impact clickthrough rates—a 25% difference can determine paid acquisition success

**Ladder of Product Awareness (LPA)**
The LPA illustrates audience positioning across five awareness levels. Those higher on the ladder require less effort to convert.

### Copywriting Frameworks

#### Framework 1: Problem-Solution-Benefit
Identify the challenge, explain the resolution, then clarify the resulting advantage. These elements can be interweaved in any order.

#### Framework 2: Differentiation
Highlight competitive advantages—whether through exclusivity, speed, cost, quality, or proprietary technology.

#### Framework 3: Compelling Questions
Pose intriguing questions prompting "I didn't know that" or "Tell me more" responses. Avoid generic yes/no questions.

#### Framework 4: Audience Matching
Appeal to specific demographic or behavioral subsets by aligning value propositions with their unique priorities.

### Ideation Process

1. Identify product benefits and audience concerns
2. Write one-sentence pitches addressing each
3. Inject intriguing context for compelling delivery
4. Eliminate needless words for maximum conciseness

### Behavioral vs. Profile-Based Targeting

**Behavior-based** (Google, YouTube, Pinterest): Identify LPA position through search keyword specificity

**Profile-based** (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn): Rely on social profile details as LPA proxies, requiring more contextual copy

### Ad Creative Design Principles

1. **Depict Product in Action** - Show the value literally
2. **Label Your Creative** - Overlay text describing what's being advertised
3. **Purposeful Visuals** - Every element should convey product value
4. **Match Surrounding Aesthetics** - Design ads to belong within their platform's context

### Call-to-Action Strategy

Use action verbs teasing the next funnel step: "Watch," "See," "Browse," "Experiment," "Play"

---

## 5. User Onboarding

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/onboarding

### Core Problem
95% of new SaaS users are lost within 90 days, primarily during onboarding when first impressions form.

### Definition
Onboarding spans from signup to user engagement, comprising:
- **First experience**: Initial product interaction post-signup
- **Follow-on engagement**: Emails, notifications, support, and content maintaining user interest

### Strategic Framework

**Four-Step Approach:**
1. Identify the product's core value proposition
2. Map the user journey toward experiencing that value
3. Identify obstacles along the path
4. Address obstacles through thoughtful onboarding design

### Four Principles for Addressing Obstacles

#### 1. Educational Component
Users need immediate clarity: "What is this product's value and how do I achieve it?"

Implementation methods:
- Productive walkthroughs guiding users through key features
- Short, focused videos (under 1 minute)
- Pre-filled sample data reducing meaningless entry work
- Strategic tooltips highlighting features

#### 2. Enticement
Build excitement by visualizing desirable outcomes during onboarding. Key insight: "Don't ask someone to do something until you've excited them about the value they'll get from it."

#### 3. Friction Reduction
- Minimize required actions before engagement
- Pre-fill forms intelligently
- Break complex tasks into visual, incremental steps
- Maintain clarity about next steps

#### 4. Productivity
Longer onboarding experiences should deliver tangible value, leaving users with accomplishments and positive reinforcement.

### Virality Integration

**Inherent Virality**: Product functionality requiring user invitations (PayPal, Dropbox, Slack)

**Word-of-Mouth**: Organic sharing from delighted users

**Artificial Virality**: Incentivized referral programs rewarding product access

**Optimization metrics:**
- Time between signup and referral
- Referrals per user
- Invitation acceptance rate
- Viral coefficient (above 1.0 indicates growth potential)

---

## 6. Running Ads

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/run-ads

### Core Overview
Social advertising strategy applicable across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn platforms.

### Key Metrics

- **CPM:** Cost per thousand impressions
- **CPC:** Cost per click
- **CTR:** Click-through rate percentage
- **CPA:** Cost per conversion event
- **LTV:** Lifetime customer value
- **Reach:** Distinct individuals seeing ads

### Campaign Hierarchy
Campaign → Ad Set → Ad. Organize by product category, then segment by audience and value proposition.

### Setup Steps

1. Install conversion tracking pixel
2. Set budgets enabling 3,000-5,000 impressions per ad set
3. Create initial ad sets with distinct value propositions
4. Monitor daily performance via dashboard
5. Eliminate underperforming ads (low CTR relative to peers)
6. Continuously optimize top performers through iteration
7. Allocate 15% budget for experimental campaigns

### Targeting Strategy

**Geographic:** Tier 1 countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia) cost most but convert better.

**Demographics:** Avoid premature restrictions. Test broadly, segment by actual converter data. Target ages 22-50 for baseline.

**Lookalikes:** Upload 1,000-5,000 best customers as seed audience. Use 1% similarity setting (2M people).

### Ad Components

**Text:** Two concise sentences describing problem solved or value offered.

**Creative:** Video typically outperforms static images. Hook viewers within 5 seconds. Include closed captioning.

**Headline:** Feature social proof or secondary value proposition.

**CTA Button:** "Learn More" and "Shop Now" convert best.

### Optimization Process

**Ad Fatigue Management:** When CTR declines, reduce daily budgets. If CPAs become unprofitable, pause campaigns ~5 weeks, then resume.

**Testing Protocol:** Change one component per iteration. Create new ads rather than editing existing ones.

**Minimum Sample Size:** Require ~3,000 impressions before determining if ads underperform.

### Retargeting Strategy

Target non-converters with new value propositions. Create four custom audiences:
1. Site visitors (past 90 days)
2. High-engagement visitors (top 25% time spent)
3. 3-day exclusion audience
4. Converted customer exclusion

Retargeting typically costs less than prospecting—allocate ~20% of budget here.

---

## 7. Content Marketing

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/content-marketing

### Core Value Proposition

Content marketing serves as a powerful alternative when ads and sales strategies underperform. It educates customers, builds audience relationships, establishes competency, and improves retention.

### Four Primary Objectives

1. Create shareable, viral content attracting new customers

## 8. A/B Testing

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/growth/ab-tests

### Core Concept
A/B testing is the systematic practice of testing variations to improve conversion rates.

### The A/B Testing Cycle
1. Identify a change to test
2. Display the variant to half your audience
3. Continue testing until reaching statistical significance
4. Review results to determine if positive impact occurred
5. Document findings for future reference
6. Repeat continuously

### Key Principle: Macro Over Micro

**Macro variants** represent substantial redesigns capable of producing 50-300% conversion improvements.

**Micro variants** involve small adjustments, typically delivering 1-5% improvements at most.

### Sourcing Test Ideas
- Customer support and sales team feedback
- User surveys about valued features
- Analysis of top-performing advertisements
- Competitor website structures
- Visitor behavior tracking tools (Hotjar, FullStory)
- Previous test results

### Statistical Validity Requirements
- 1,000+ visits validate 6.3%+ conversion increases
- 10,000+ visits validate 2%+ increases
- Aim for 70%+ probability in "Probability to be Best"

### Critical Success Factors
- Test one variant at a time per audience
- Run variants simultaneously, not sequentially
- Consider targeting only new users
- Measure impact on bottom-line metrics
- Prioritize tests by confidence, potential impact, and effort

### Major Takeaway
"Never have downtime; every day of the year, a test should be running—or you're letting traffic go to waste."
