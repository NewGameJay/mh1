## About This Course

About this course

Growth isn't about individual parts but the alignment between your Market, Product, Model, Brand, and Channel. When these "fits" work together, the entire system compounds and creates sustainable growth that feels effortless.

The framework provides practical filters for decision-making. Product-Market Fit establishes core value alignment, Model-Market Fit ensures financial viability, and Product-Channel Fit matches your product to channel rules. Brand-Market Fit amplifies everything else, while layered filtering helps you systematically eliminate unsuitable channels and focus on what actually works for your specific business configuration.

LESSON
It’s about alignment, not parts

In the last lesson, we introduced the Foundational Five, our core framework for engineering growth into the foundation of our business. Now, we're going to show just how practical this framework is.

The Key Insight

Growth is not about the individual parts of your foundation, but the fits between them.

Meaning, it's not enough to just have an exceptional product. Or just an awe-inspiring brand.

It's the alignment of your Market, Product, Model, Brand, and Channel that unlocks sustainable, scalable growth.

When these seams line up, the entire system compounds.

When they fight against each other, growth feels like an uphill battle.

This lesson will show you how to use these "fits" to make fewer, bigger, and better decisions.

How the Foundational Five is much more than some high-level concept, but instead is a tool that allows us to make very real, high-leverage decisions.

And best of all, how it enables us to make those calls in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take if you were taking a purely "test-and-iterate" approach.
