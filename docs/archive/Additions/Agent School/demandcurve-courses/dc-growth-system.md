## About This Course

Stop treating growth like guesswork. Start engineering it like a system.

Most founders chase random marketing tactics, hoping something will stick. They feel anxious about growth because it seems uncontrollable and unpredictable. The DC Growth System changes that entirely. Built from a decade of working with thousands of startups, this system transforms growth from a mystery into a predictable engine you can control.

You'll master the Foundational Five pillars, identify your growth catalysts, and build a growth engine powered by self-reinforcing flywheels. Instead of random acts of marketing, you'll have a quantitative model showing exactly where growth comes from and which levers to pull to unlock it rapidly.

### Lesson 1: Meet Your Growth System

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/meet-your-growth-system

LESSON
Meet your growth system

Alright, welcome to the first part of your company path. In case you missed the intro, I'm Justin Setzer, CEO and co-founder of Demand Curve.

I’ll be guiding you through the first core parts of the Growth Program to help you build your growth engine. I'll be guiding you through the key strategic concepts to help you level up as a growth thinker and operator. And that all begins with our growth system:

This is a system that we have honed after a decade-plus of working with thousands of startups, from pre-launch, bootstrapped products to some of the fastest-growing companies in the world.

One of the things that we credit our success, and the success of the companies we work with, is the fact that we take a very systematic approach to growth.

That’s the system that you're about to learn.

With our growth system, you will be able to go from feeling like growth is this nebulous, uncontrollable, anxiety-inducing component of your startup, to understanding every knob and dial that you can push and turn to engineer your growth on command. 

That said, let's get into it!

So, why a system?

At the highest level, this system will help you not just make decisions, but also build what typically takes startups years to do, in a matter of months. You will also produce the kind of growth that many operators and founders chase after for years, and sometimes never achieve. You'll be able to put yourself in the best possible position to produce those levels of results... in a matter of months.

It's going to take you away from pursuing random acts of marketing and sales, and feeling like you have no understanding of how your business is actually growing (or how it's meant to grow). You'll be able to install a system that shows precisely where growth comes from, what's preventing it, and how to move the right levers and remove key constraints to unlock growth rapidly. Most importantly, you're going to walk away with an understanding of a quantitative and qualitative model and map for exactly how your business grows.

So let's take a look at the Growth System

As you can see, there are several components to it. We're going to begin at the highest level with what we call our Foundational Five. This is the foundation the rest of the system is built on.

The Foundational Five are the prerequisites that make growth possible. Without a solid base, growth will always feel like an uphill battle.

On top of that base sit your Growth Catalysts. Catalysts answer not just why a company grows, but why some achieve breakout success.

The next layer of our system is our growth engine. And this is ultimately what you're in the Growth Program to build. With a growth engine, we achieve predictable, scalable, and controllable growth. In other words, we have growth that isn't driven by hustle and time. 

From there, we’ll move into the executional and tactical layers. We’ll cover your channels, the engine controls you can adjust to reduce friction and accelerate growth, the fuel that powers your engine, and the enhancements that make it bigger and stronger over time.

And finally, we’ll close with the growth process. The layer that installs a simple but rigorous system for generating learnings that will enable you to continuously enhance your engine and identify additional growth levers.

The System Produces Your Growth Strategy

Many of you joined this program with one primary goal: to build a growth strategy.

And I have good news. That’s exactly what you’re doing here.

Before we dive into the first layer of the Growth System, let’s clarify what we mean by strategy and how our approach works. These days, most of my time is spent thinking about, discussing, and developing growth strategies.

And if there’s one thing I can confidently say, it’s that strategy is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the startup world. On one end, I see teams that put together goals and roadmaps and declare, “Voilà, strategy!” On the other, I see teams who treat it like some mystical exercise, trying to peer into the future and map out every move for the next decade.

In reality, strategy is far more straightforward. 

Good strategy means identifying the right problem, diagnosing its root causes, setting the boundaries you have to work within, and defining the rules of the game that inform how and what you’ll do to solve it.

So what does that look like within the Growth Program? Your strategy needs to answer six core questions:

Each question maps directly to a layer of the Growth System, which means that by building your system, you are building your strategy.

This is why we say this program helps you accomplish in months what takes most startups years.

You’re not stitching together random tactics.

You’re constructing a strategy rooted in the foundations and systems of your business.

### Lesson 2: The Foundational Five

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/foundational-five

LESSON
The Foundational Five

So let's get into the first layer of the system, which starts with your foundation.

This is a crucial concept to understand: growth isn't driven by channels or tactics. And it’s certainly not driven by “hacks.”

Actual growth happens when it's engineered into the foundation of your business.

The Foundational Layer

We call this our Foundational Five, and it consists of the five components you see here: your market, your product, your model, your brand, and your channel.

We'll be examining the Foundational Five much deeper in part two. For now, the high-level overview is this: your market is, of course, who you’re serving. Your model explains how you monetize. Your product is what you have to offer to your market.

As we teach it, we want you to think of brand much more as your story and your message. It’s the fuel that we push out through our channels to attract our market.

Finally, the fifth component of the Foundational Five is your channel. To be clear, this isn't meant to be perceived as a single channel. This is intended to be viewed more broadly as how you acquire customers and bring them into your ecosystem. 

Key Call-Out: Alignment

One more important call-out before we move into the next part of the system: The key with the Foundational Five is alignment.

We all know the concept of product-market fit, and we're going to be exploring throughout the program how product-market fit simply isn’t enough. What really explains true growth is having alignment and fit across all five of these foundational pillars.

Why the Foundational Five Matters

We're going to be coming back to the Foundational Five consistently throughout the program. In fact, it guides nearly every decision we make, even getting into the tactical layer.

This brings up the last key talking point for the Foundational Five at this moment, which is that almost all of you in this program are here to, one, build your growth engine, and two, specifically figure out how to acquire customers at scale.

What you may already be seeing and intuiting is that if we understand that our growth must be engineered into the foundation, and that our five foundational pillars must be built with alignment, then if we can understand and define our product, market, brand, and model, those alignments will essentially design our acquisition strategy for us.

That's exactly why we created this framework. And why it’s such a centerpiece of the program.

### Lesson 3: Growth Catalysts

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/growth-catalysts

LESSON
Growth Catalysts

Now let's examine the second layer of your foundation: growth catalysts.

As said, your Foundational Five explains the conditions required for growth to be possible. It doesn't, however, inherently explain how and why breakout growth happens.

Or, put very simply, the Foundational Five tells us if we’ll grow. Growth Catalysts explain how fast and how much we’ll grow. 

After years of working with many, many companies, our answer to breakout success is growth catalysts.

What Is a Growth Catalyst?

In a nutshell, a growth catalyst is your edge, or your advantage.

As you can see, we have identified seven buckets of catalysts through our time working with some of the fastest-growing startups in the world. We have market, product, model, brand, channel, and company catalysts.

In part two of the program, we're going to go much deeper into the catalysts to help you identify which ones may be an opportunity for you today, and, possibly more importantly, which ones have potential for you to engineer into your foundation over time.

### Lesson 4: Motions

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/motions

LESSON
Motions

Let's now move into the second layer of your growth system: your growth engine.

Again, this is the key outcome we are trying to help you reach in the Growth Program: scalable, predictable, repeatable growth.

The Three Motions of the Growth Engine

At the core, your growth engine has three motions. To be clear, motions are systems, not channels or tactics.

Our three motions are our acquisition motion (how we bring in net new users and create our first relationship with them), our monetization motion (how we turn that initial interest and relationship into revenue), and our retention motion (how we keep and grow our existing customer base).

What this visual is showing us is that our motions work together in a compounding nature. Acquisition fuels our engine. Monetization captures value. That value can then be returned and fed back into our acquisition motion to drive additional customer acquisition. And it can also be pumped into our retention motion.

Retention as the Critical Driver

Retention, the most critical component of your growth engine, both expands and increases the potential value that we can generate from a customer, kicking even more revenue back into the top of our acquisition motion.

It can also serve as its own acquisition driver through referrals or, more broadly, virality, which we'll explore more throughout this program.

Ultimately, our growth engine does not operate in a vacuum.

Every startup has constraints that determine the type of engine that is feasible to build, given the current stage and reality. There are assumptions that must be validated to move us to the next stage. And we all have unique goals that inform not only where we want to go, but also how we want to achieve it.

We call these our Growth Guardrails, and you’ll define yours in Part 3 of the program.

### Lesson 5: Funnels

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/funnels

LESSON
Funnels

Up until now, we’ve been talking about growth at the system level. Now we’re zooming in on how we measure the performance of our engine.

Funnels give us a way to measure how people progress through the buying journey, from awareness through retention and monetization. They’re snapshots of how effectively we’re moving people from one stage to the next.‍

Growth models go deeper. They describe, with much more granularity, how people are actually moving through your entire business and product. A growth model connects the dots between your motions, your funnel, and your economics. It tells you how your engine produces growth, the levers to pull to generate even more growth, as well as the constraints keeping your engine from working at full capacity.

Think of it this way:

Motions set the structure of your growth engine.
Funnels measure how people flow through that engine.
Growth models explain the mechanics of why and how the engine produces growth.

Keep in mind: your funnel and model will look very different from another company’s. That’s the whole reason we start at the systematic level. There are no playbooks or cookie-cutter paths. Your foundation is unique. Which means your engine is unique. So how you measure and model your engine will be unique as well.

Later in this program, we’ll teach you exactly how to build and apply your specific growth model and funnel.

### Lesson 6: Growth Strategy

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/growth-strategy

LESSON
Growth Strategy

We kicked off by saying the Growth System produces your growth strategy. And that’s partially true. With an important caveat.

At this point, you’ve designed the system-level layers: your Foundational Five, any viable catalysts, and the configuration of your motions.

But systems alone aren’t a strategy. 

This is the layer where you define how those systems will be brought to life. It’s where you decide not just the channels you’ll use or the fuel you’ll inject, but, tactically, how you’ll wield them.

In other words, this is where you codify everything into a guiding policy that turns the bones of your system into a true strategy. Which brings us to the next part of the Growth System: The Execution Layer.

### Lesson 7: Execution Layer

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/execution-layer

LESSON
Execution Layer

We are now into the execution layer. This is how you bring the system and engine to life.

These are the specific channels and tactics used within our three motions.

The “fuel” (content, story, design, copy) we push through those channels. The “lubricants” we use to remove friction and increase user delight and conversion rates. And the infrastructure that supports the many moving parts within this layer.

I said at the beginning that scalable and defensible growth does not start at the execution layer.

Yet this is exactly where we see so many startups begin (and even later-stage companies too, if we’re being honest).

They start from an execution layer and then work backwards. They look for tactics and competitive playbooks that they can clone. That’s the complete opposite of what you need to be doing.

Why It Works Better Here

As we move into the execution layer of this program, you’ll have already constructed a strong foundation, which means the execution layer will only work that much better.

Just as importantly, that foundation will make it far easier to identify the tools and tactics to focus on, and which ones you can confidently ignore.

### Lesson 8: The Growth Process

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/growth-process

LESSON
The Growth Process

Finally, once your growth system is in place, the final component is the growth process.

At the heart of the growth process is the learning flywheel. As we will talk about in the next lesson, at the end of the day.

Growth is a learning generator. Learnings are one of the most critical fuels that power our entire business. The growth process is how we generate those learnings, and how we generate better and faster learnings than your competition. 

We're going to teach you a simple process that you can implement at your company—regardless of size, stage, sophistication, or resources—that will give you an edge against larger players.

### Lesson 9: Flywheels

**URL:** https://www.demandcurve.com/lessons/flywheels

LESSON
Flywheels

We’ve now walked through the foundation, the catalysts that give you an edge, the motions that define how your engine runs, and the process that generates the learnings necessary to remove friction and uncover new growth levers.

But there’s one last, very important concept to cover: flywheels.

A flywheel is a self-reinforcing system. Each cycle makes the next cycle easier and more powerful, which means results compound over time. 

And flywheels show up across multiple layers of your growth system.

Catalyst flywheels exist within the foundation, turning advantages like network effects into exponential momentum.
Motion flywheels power your acquisition, monetization, and retention motions, making your growth engine spin faster as you feed it.
Learning flywheels are created through the growth process, transforming experiments into compounding gains. Each test produces insights, which create leverage, as well as new hypotheses to run through the cycle.

When you see these three layers stacked together, you start to understand why we think of growth as system design and not a collection of tactics. 

Flywheels are the mechanism that turns your foundation, your catalysts, and your motions into compounding systems. When we say we’re going to help you build a growth engine that is scalable, predictable, and repeatable… flywheels are the core force that makes those outcomes real.

Alright, that’s a wrap.

That’s the overview of the DC Growth System. We have one more lesson before we get into the thick of it and begin constructing your system: “Guiding Principles.”

We’ll see you there!
