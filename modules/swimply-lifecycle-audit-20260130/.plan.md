## Output Format

Each skill produces a **2-page report** with:

**Page 1:**
- Executive Summary
- Key Findings (3-5 bullets)
- Data Sources Used
- Primary Analysis

**Page 2:**
- Detailed Findings
- Recommendations
- Next Steps
- Appendix (data tables if applicable)

---

## Resume Instructions

If execution is interrupted:

1. Check the last successful checkpoint above
2. Continue from the next pending skill
3. All completed reports are in `reports/` directory

## Notes

- **Data Source:** Braze is the primary data platform (no separate CRM/warehouse)
- **Seasonality:** Current data is winter (off-peak) - note in all analyses
- **Two-Sided Marketplace:** Guest and Host funnels analyzed separately where applicable
- **Report Location:** All reports saved to `modules/swimply-lifecycle-audit-20260130/reports/`
