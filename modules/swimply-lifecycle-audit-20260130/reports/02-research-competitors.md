## Page 1: Executive Summary & Key Findings

### Executive Summary

Swimply operates in the broader "space-as-a-service" marketplace category, competing indirectly with several platforms that offer alternative ways to access premium amenities. While no direct competitor matches Swimply's pool rental focus and scale, adjacent players like ResortPass (hotel day passes), Peerspace (event spaces), and Sniffspot (private dog parks) demonstrate the viability of the hourly amenity rental model. Swimply's first-mover advantage and category ownership provide significant competitive moats.

### Key Findings

1. **No Direct Competitor at Scale:** Swimply has effectively created and owns the "pool sharing" category in the US
2. **Adjacent Threat: ResortPass** - Growing rapidly with hotel amenity day passes, could expand to residential
3. **Horizontal Expansion Risk:** Airbnb or VRBO could add hourly amenity features to existing platforms
4. **International Gaps:** Swimmy (EU) and other regional players have minimal US presence
5. **Vertical Specialists:** Sniffspot (dog parks) and court rental apps prove the model works for niche amenities

### Primary Competitors Matrix

| Competitor | Category | Funding | Scale | Threat Level |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|--------------|
| ResortPass | Hotel day passes | $52M | 900+ hotels | **Medium-High** |
| Peerspace | Event spaces | $45M | 10K+ spaces | **Medium** |
| Sniffspot | Dog parks | $8M | 8K+ spots | **Low** |
| Swimmy | Pool rental (EU) | <$5M | EU only | **Low** |
| Airbnb | Accommodation | $6B+ | 7M+ listings | **Latent High** |

## Page 2: Detailed Competitor Profiles & Strategic Implications

### ResortPass - Primary Competitive Threat

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2016 |
| **HQ** | Los Angeles, CA |
| **Funding** | $52M (Series B, 2022) |
| **Model** | Day passes to hotel pools, spas, fitness |
| **Coverage** | 900+ hotels globally |
| **Investors** | Andreessen Horowitz, Declaration Partners |

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- Targets same consumer need (pool access without ownership)
- Premium positioning ($50-300/day vs. Swimply's ~$45/hour)
- Hotel inventory = higher quality assurance
- Could expand to residential partnerships
- **Differentiation:** Swimply offers private, exclusive experience vs. ResortPass shared hotel spaces

### Peerspace - Adjacent Market

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2014 |
| **HQ** | San Francisco, CA |
| **Funding** | $45M+ |
| **Model** | Event space rentals by the hour |
| **Coverage** | 10,000+ spaces, major US/EU cities |

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- Overlapping use case for backyard events
- Similar commission model (10-15%)
- Could add pool-specific category
- **Differentiation:** Swimply focuses on amenity usage vs. Peerspace on full venue rental

### Sniffspot - Proof of Model

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2018 |
| **Funding** | $8M |
| **Model** | Private dog park rentals by the hour |
| **Coverage** | 8,000+ spots, US-wide |

**Strategic Insight:** Validates the hourly amenity rental model for niche verticals. Swimply's expansion into courts follows similar playbook.

### Swimmy - International Analog

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2017 |
| **HQ** | Paris, France |
| **Model** | Pool rentals (Swimply clone for Europe) |
| **Coverage** | France, Spain, Italy primarily |

**Strategic Insight:** Minimal threat to US market. Potential acquisition target for Swimply's European expansion.

### Latent Competitive Threats

**Airbnb Experiences:**
- Already has hourly experiences feature
- Could easily add "pool access" category
- Massive distribution advantage
- **Mitigation:** Swimply's specialization and host community create switching costs

**VRBO/Expedia:**
- Similar platform capabilities
- Less likely given accommodation focus
- Corporate strategy favors full-property rentals

**Google/Apple:**
- Local services discovery
- Could partner or compete
- More likely to be distribution channel than competitor

### Competitive Advantages (Swimply)

| Advantage | Defensibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Category ownership** | High - "Swimply" becoming verb like "Uber" |
| **Host network effects** | High - 15K hosts is significant moat |
| **Brand trust** | Medium - $1M guarantee is differentiator |
| **Data/ML** | Medium - Pricing, matching algorithms |
| **Geographic density** | High - Network effects in top markets |

### Strategic Recommendations

**Defensive Moves:**
1. Accelerate host acquisition in key markets before competitors scale
2. Lock in hosts with better economics, tools, and community
3. Build brand awareness to own "pool sharing" category
4. Consider strategic partnerships with hotels (defensive against ResortPass)

**Offensive Moves:**
1. Expand courts/amenities faster than competitors
2. Enter B2B corporate events market
3. International expansion to preempt Swimmy
4. Consider acquiring smaller regional players

### Competitive Intelligence Gaps

| Gap | Priority | Recommended Action |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| ResortPass growth rate | High | Track press releases, job postings |
| Airbnb product roadmap | High | Monitor Airbnb announcements |
| Host churn to competitors | Medium | Add exit survey data |
| International market size | Medium | Commission market research |
