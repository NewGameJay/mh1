## Resume Instructions

If execution is interrupted:

1. Check which competitors were fully researched
2. Review `runs/` for partial outputs
3. Run: `module.continue_from_checkpoint()`
4. Only incomplete competitors will be re-researched

---

## Post-Execution Steps

1. Review competitor profiles for accuracy
2. Validate feature comparison with product team
3. Get sales feedback on battle cards
4. Schedule competitive intel refresh (quarterly recommended)
