## Resume Instructions

If execution is interrupted:

1. Check the last successful checkpoint above
2. Review `runs/` directory for partial outputs
3. Run: `module.continue_from_checkpoint()`
4. The module will resume from the next pending skill

For ghostwrite-content specifically:
- Check `posts/` directory for incremental batch saves
- Resume will skip completed batches

---

## Post-Execution Steps

1. Review generated posts for voice authenticity
2. Check content calendar dates align with client schedule
3. Get founder approval on voice/tone
4. Transfer approved posts to publishing queue
5. Schedule follow-up content production
