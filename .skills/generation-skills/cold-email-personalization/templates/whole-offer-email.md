<template_type>
Whole Offer Campaign - Subject + preview = entire value proposition
</template_type>

<when_to_use>
Use when:
- Limited research data available
- Your offer is self-selecting (they either need it or don't)
- You want to cast a wider net
- Email 3 reset (when AI personalization hasn't worked)
</when_to_use>

<key_principle>
The subject line + first line preview text = your entire offer.

They self-select: either they have this problem (open) or they don't (ignore, less likely to spam).
</key_principle>

<structure>
```
Subject: [Pain point question or statement - can be longer than 4 words]

{{First_name}},

[Explain the problem in 1-2 sentences]

[Explain your solution in 1-2 sentences]

[Optional: Light personalization with {{variable}}]

[Simple CTA: "Worth exploring?" or "Would that be useful?"]
```
</structure>

<template_a>
**Property Management Example**

```
Subject: Ever chase renters for rent?

{{First_name}},

We reward renters for paying on time so you increase NOI.

Renters who pay on time get Starbucks gift cards they can spend at {{nearest_mall}}.

If we could increase on-time payments, would that be useful?
```

**Word count:** 52 words
</template_a>

<template_b>
**Scaling Without Headcount**

```
Subject: Scaling outbound without headcount

{{First_name}},

Most teams hit a wall when they need to 3x outbound volume but can't justify 3x headcount.

We've built automation that combines 40+ databases so your reps spend zero time on manual research.

Helped companies like yours go from 100 → 500 emails/day per rep with the same team size.

Worth exploring?
```

**Word count:** 62 words
</template_b>

<template_c>
**Problem + Solution + Proof**

```
Subject: [Problem they face]

{{First_name}},

[Describe the problem they have - 1 sentence]

[Explain your solution - 1 sentence]

[Case study with specific metric - 1 sentence]

[Binary CTA]
```

**Example filled:**
```
Subject: Pipeline review taking too long?

{{First_name}},

Most sales leaders spend 4+ hours per week on pipeline review because data is scattered across tools.

We consolidate everything into one dashboard with automated insights.

Helped similar teams cut review time to 30 minutes.

Worth a look?
```
</template_c>

<template_d>
**Self-Selecting Question**

```
Subject: [Yes/No question about their pain]

{{First_name}},

[Expand on the question - what problem does this cause?]

[Your solution in one sentence]

[Optional: metric or social proof]

[Low-effort CTA]
```

**Example filled:**
```
Subject: Still manually enriching lead data?

{{First_name}},

Manual enrichment kills SDR productivity—most spend 10-15 min per prospect before even writing the email.

We pull from 40+ databases automatically so your team can focus on sending, not researching.

Worth a look?
```
</template_d>

<subject_line_patterns>
**Whole Offer Subject Lines (can be longer):**

Pain-focused:
- "Ever chase renters to pay on time?"
- "Pipeline review taking too long?"
- "Still manually enriching lead data?"
- "Scaling outbound without headcount"

Question format:
- "Do you [painful task]?"
- "Are you still [manual process]?"
- "Struggling with [problem]?"

Statement format:
- "[Problem] solved"
- "[Outcome] without [sacrifice]"
- "The [industry] secret to [outcome]"
</subject_line_patterns>

<light_personalization>
Even in whole-offer campaigns, you can add light touches:

- {{nearest_mall}} - Local relevance
- {{city}} - Geographic
- {{company_name}} - Basic personalization
- {{industry}} - Sector relevance
- {{role_title}} - Role-specific angle

These don't require deep research but add a personal touch.
</light_personalization>

<when_not_to_use>
Don't use whole-offer strategy when:
- You have strong custom signals (use those instead)
- The prospect is high-value and worth deeper research
- Your offer requires explanation (too complex for subject + preview)
</when_not_to_use>

<word_count_target>
40-70 words (whole-offer emails should be extra tight since there's less personalization to justify length)
</word_count_target>

<checklist>
- [ ] Subject + preview = complete offer
- [ ] Problem is clear in 1 sentence
- [ ] Solution is clear in 1 sentence
- [ ] CTA is binary (yes/no)
- [ ] Under 70 words
- [ ] Would self-select the right people
</checklist>
