<objective>
"Poke the bear" openers that trigger a response by acknowledging their current situation and implying there might be a better way.
</objective>

<pattern_1>
**Classic**

Ask about their current process:
- "Do you already have a reliable way to {{problem}}?"
- "How are you currently handling {{process}}?"
- "Who owns {{area}} internally today?"

**When to use:** You're not sure what they're doing now and want to find out.

**Example:**
"How are you currently handling lead enrichment at scale?"
</pattern_1>

<pattern_2>
**Status Pressure / FOMO**

Imply they might be behind:
- "Have you solved {{problem}} yet or is it still manual?"
- "Are you already doing {{practice}} like the top firms in your space?"
- "Have you figured out how to do {{outcome}} without adding headcount?"

**When to use:** You suspect they're not doing it well and want to create urgency.

**Example:**
"Have you figured out how to personalize at scale without adding headcount, or is that still manual?"
</pattern_2>

<pattern_3>
**Soft Humility**

Acknowledge you might be wrong:
- "I may be wrong, but do you have something in place for {{area}}?"
- "Totally possible you solved this—how do you handle {{process}} today?"

**When to use:** You're reaching out to someone senior and want to seem respectful.

**Example:**
"Totally possible you've solved this—how do you handle pipeline review today?"
</pattern_3>

<pattern_4>
**Efficiency / Leverage**

Focus on doing more with less:
- "How are you doing {{task}} without adding headcount?"
- "What's your process for {{task}} without manual work?"

**When to use:** You know they're resource-constrained or trying to scale.

**Example:**
"How are you scaling outbound without adding more SDRs?"
</pattern_4>

<pattern_5>
**Risk-Based**

Focus on what could go wrong:
- "How are you avoiding {{negative_outcome}} as you scale?"
- "How do you make sure {{critical_task}} doesn't slip through the cracks?"

**When to use:** Your solution prevents bad outcomes (compliance, security, churn).

**Example:**
"How are you avoiding compliance issues as you scale into new markets?"
</pattern_5>

<pattern_6>
**Binary**

Simple yes/no question:
- "Is your process for {{area}} where you want it?"
- "Will your current setup scale 12 more months?"

**When to use:** You want a quick response and can handle either answer.

**Example:**
"Is your current CRM setup where you want it, or are you looking to upgrade?"
</pattern_6>

<pattern_7>
**Redirect (Fallback)**

When you're not sure they're the right person:
- "Let me know if {{employee_1}} or {{employee_2}} would be better to speak about {{problem}}"

**When to use:** You're reaching out to someone who might not own this area.

**Example:**
"Let me know if Sarah or Marcus would be better to speak about your outbound strategy."
</pattern_7>

<pattern_8>
**Observation + Question**

Lead with specific observation, follow with question:
- "Saw you {{did something}} — are you also thinking about {{related thing}}?"
- "Noticed {{signal}} — have you figured out {{related process}}?"

**When to use:** You have a specific research signal to lead with.

**Example:**
"Saw you hired 4 SDRs last quarter—are you building custom workflows for every deal, or is there a plan to productize those patterns?"
</pattern_8>

<pattern_9>
**"Specifically" Line**

Show you understand their specific customer:
- "Specifically, it looks like you're trying to sell to {{customer_type}}, and we can help with that."

**When to use:**
- ✅ Your service applies universally but their customers vary
- ✅ B2B services where you can AI-generate their customer type
- ❌ Obvious target markets (vacuum cleaners → hotels)

**Example:**
"Specifically, it looks like you're trying to sell to VPs of Finance, and we can help with that."
</pattern_9>

<pattern_combinations>
**Combining Patterns**

You can combine patterns for more impact:

**Observation + Status Pressure:**
"Saw you posted about {{topic}}—have you figured out how to maintain that consistency, or is it still ad hoc?"

**Binary + Efficiency:**
"Is your current setup for {{process}} where you want it, or are you looking for a way to do it without manual work?"

**Risk-Based + "Specifically":**
"How are you avoiding {{risk}} as you scale? Specifically, it looks like you're dealing with {{their specific situation}}."
</pattern_combinations>

<what_to_avoid>
**Openers to Avoid:**

❌ "I hope this email finds you well" (delete entirely)
❌ "I wanted to reach out because..." (get to the point)
❌ "I noticed you're in the {{industry}} industry" (obvious, not impressive)
❌ "We help companies like yours..." (about you, not them)
❌ "I came across your profile and..." (vague, templated)

**Replace with:** A specific observation + question that triggers a response.
