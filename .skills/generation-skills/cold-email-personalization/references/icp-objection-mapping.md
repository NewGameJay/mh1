<objective>
Role-play as your skeptical ICP before writing any campaign. This helps you write defensively (preempt objections) and focus on THEIR world (not your product).
</objective>

<the_exercise>
Before writing ANY cold email campaign, spend 15 minutes role-playing as your skeptical ICP.

**Why this matters:**
- You'll write defensively (preempt objections before they voice them)
- You'll focus on THEIR world (not your product)
- You'll understand what they ACTUALLY care about (not what you think they should)
</the_exercise>

<step_1_questions>
**Put Yourself in Their Shoes**

Answer these questions:

**1. How are they doing this now?**
- What's their current solution? (tool, manual process, nothing)
- What does a typical day/week look like for them?
- Who else is involved in this process?

**2. Why would they switch?**
- What's broken about their current solution?
- What pain is urgent enough to justify change?
- What's the "last straw" moment?

**3. What's their switching cost?**
- **Time:** How long to implement/onboard?
- **Money:** Budget approval, contract obligations
- **Political:** Will this make them look bad if it fails?
- **Risk:** What if the new solution doesn't work?

**4. What objections will they have?**
Common objections:
- "We already have X"
- "We don't have budget"
- "We tried something like this before and it didn't work"
- "We're too small/big for this"
- "I don't have time to evaluate this"
- "My boss won't approve this"
- "We're locked into a contract"
</step_1_questions>

<step_2_personal_benefit>
**Personal Benefit (Not Just Business ROI)**

**The Truth:** Unless they're the CEO, they're not thinking about company goals 24/7.

Most people want to:
1. Do their job well enough to avoid criticism
2. Go home on time
3. Look smart to their boss
4. Get promoted (maybe)
5. Avoid extra work

**Your job:** Connect your offer to THEIR personal wins, not just business ROI.

**Examples:**
- HR person (health insurance): "Not only a big win for the company, but you'd personally benefit from picking your own plans"
- Finance person: "Makes budget planning easier AND gets you a win with leadership"
- Ops person: "One less fire drill + makes you look like a hero"

**For every campaign, map TWO wins:**
- **Business win:** What the company gets
- **Personal win:** What THEY get individually
</step_2_personal_benefit>

<mapping_template>
**Complete this for each role you target:**

```
Role: [VP Sales, Director of Ops, etc.]

Responsible for:
- [Primary KPI #1]
- [Primary KPI #2]
- [Primary KPI #3]

Success looks like:
- [What a "win" is in their role]
- [What gets them promoted]
- [What gets them praised]

Failure looks like:
- [What gets them in trouble]
- [What keeps them up at night]
- [What makes them look bad]

Current solution:
- [How they do this today]
- [What's annoying about it]
- [What breaks when things scale]

Our solution offers:
- Business win: [What the company gets]
- Personal win: [What THEY get individually]

Switching costs:
- [Time investment required]
- [Political risk]
- [Learning curve]

Top 3 objections:
1. [Most likely objection]
2. [Second most likely]
3. [Third most likely]

How to preempt in email:
1. [Address objection 1 proactively]
2. [Address objection 2 proactively]
3. [Address objection 3 proactively]
```

<example_mappings>
**Example 1: VP of Sales (Outbound Automation)**

Responsible for: Pipeline generation, SDR productivity, Cost per lead

Success: Hitting pipeline targets without increasing budget, SDRs exceeding quotas

Failure: Missing pipeline targets (career-limiting), SDR burnout/churn

Current solution: SDRs manually research on LinkedIn, Sales Nav, generic templates

Our solution offers:
- **Business win:** 3x outbound volume with same team size
- **Personal win:** Look like a hero ("tripled pipeline without headcount"), less stress managing underperformers

Top objections → Preempts:
1. "We already have Sales Nav and Outreach" → "Have you figured out how to do personalized research at scale without adding headcount?"
2. "My SDRs are already busy" → "Most teams we work with save 10 min per prospect on research"
3. "We tried automation before and it felt robotic" → Show example with AI-generated personalization

---

**Example 2: Director of Ops (Process Automation)**

Responsible for: Operational efficiency, Cost reduction, Systems running smoothly

Success: Processes scale without breaking, No fires to put out, CEO asks "how are we so efficient?"

Failure: Systems break as company grows, Manual workarounds everywhere, Blamed for bottlenecks

Current solution: Duct-tape solutions (Zapier, spreadsheets, manual steps), Fragmented automation

Our solution offers:
- **Business win:** Scalable processes, fewer errors, lower costs
- **Personal win:** Fewer fire drills, look like a hero ("ops is no longer a bottleneck"), easier to delegate

Top objections → Preempts:
1. "We already use Zapier" → "How many zaps do you have? Most teams hit a wall at 50+ when debugging becomes impossible"
2. "We're too busy to switch" → "This actually saves time—automating the automation"
3. "Our processes are unique" → "That's exactly why we build custom workflows, not templates"

<preemption_techniques>
**How to Preempt Objections in Email**

**Technique 1: "Poke the Bear" Questions**
Frame your opener as a question that acknowledges their current state:
- ❌ "We help companies automate outbound"
- ✅ "Have you figured out how to scale outbound without adding headcount, or is that still manual?"

**Technique 2: Risk Reversal**
Address "what if this doesn't work?" early:
- "You only pay when it's successfully taken down"
- "No upfront commitment—just try it and see"
- "Most teams see results in first 30 days"

**Technique 3: Situational Social Proof**
Don't just name-drop. Show you understand their SITUATION:
- ❌ "We work with Stripe and Coinbase"
- ✅ "Most fintech teams hit this problem around month 3 after realizing PII is in trace data"

**Technique 4: Personal Benefit**
Explicitly call out what THEY get:
- "Not only a big win for the company, but you'd personally benefit from [specific thing]"
- "Makes your life easier by [specific way] + gets you a win with leadership"
</preemption_techniques>

<test_your_email>
Before sending, ask:

1. **Does this email acknowledge their current state?**
   - If no → Add a line describing how they're doing it now

2. **Does it address their #1 objection preemptively?**
   - If no → Add a line that neutralizes it

3. **Does it offer a personal win, not just business ROI?**
   - If no → Add what THEY get individually

4. **Is the switching cost clear?**
   - If unclear → Make the CTA lower-friction

5. **Would I reply to this if I were them?**
   - If no → Start over
