  "raw": "I'll execute the positioning-angles skill. Since no specific product or offer was provided, I'll need to clarify what we're finding angles for.\n\n**Error: Missing Required Input**\n\nThe positioning-angles skill requires a specific product, service, or offer to analyze. I need:\n\n1. **What product/service/offer** are we positioning?\n2. **Target audience** (who are we selling to?)\n3. **Current market context** (any existing messaging, competition, or challenges?)\n\nHowever, I can demonstrate the skill execution process using a hypothetical example relevant to the client context:\n\n---\n\n## Angle Options for [Hypothetical: Gaming Analytics Dashboard]\n\n**Context Assumptions:**\n- Product: Analytics dashboard for game developers\n- Transformation: From guessing what players want to knowing exactly what drives engagement\n- Alternatives: Basic platform analytics, hiring data scientists, manual reporting\n- Mechanism: Real-time player behavior mapping with predictive insights\n\n### Step 1: Transformation Identified\nPlayers' game experience goes from generic to personalized. Developers go from reactive to predictive.\n\n### Step 2: Competitive Landscape\n- Do nothing: Rely on basic Steam/console metrics\n- DIY: Build internal analytics (expensive, time-consuming)\n- Hire experts: Data science team ($200k+ annually)\n- Generic tools: Google Analytics for games (not game-specific)\n\n### Step 3: Unique Mechanism\nReal-time behavioral clustering with predictive churn modeling specifically built for gaming metrics.\n\n### Step 4: Market Sophistication Assessment\nStage 3 (Crowded) - Many analytics tools exist, need mechanism-based differentiation.\n\n### Step 5: Generated Angles\n\n**Angle 1: The Player Psychology Decoder**\n- The angle: Turn player behavior data into psychological insights that drive retention\n- Why it works: Goes beyond metrics to understanding WHY players act\n- Headline direction: \"Stop guessing what players want. Start knowing what they'll do next.\"\n- When to use: Audience values deep insights over surface metrics\n\n**Angle 2: The Churn Prevention System**\n- The angle: Predict and prevent player churn before it happens\n- Why it works: Addresses the expensive problem of player acquisition vs retention\n- Headline direction: \"Catch churning players 7 days before they quit\"\n- When to use: Audience is focused on retention economics and LTV\n\n**Angle 3: The Real-Time Response Engine**\n- The angle: Get actionable insights instantly, not in quarterly reports\n- Why it works: Speed advantage over traditional analytics approaches\n- Headline direction: \"Player drops off level 3? You'll know in 30 seconds, not 30 days.\"\n- When to use: Audience frustrated with delayed reporting and reactive responses\n\n**Angle 4: The Gaming-Native Analytics**\n- The angle: Built specifically for games, not adapted from web analytics\n- Why it works: Positions against generic tools that miss gaming-specific context\n- Headline direction: \"Finally, analytics that understand games aren't websites\"\n- When to use: Audience has tried generic analytics tools and found them lacking\n\n**Angle 5: The Indie Developer Equalizer**\n- The angle: Enterprise-level game intelligence at indie budgets\n- Why it works: Democratizes capabilities usually only available to big studios\n- Headline direction: \"The same player insights that power AAA games\u2014now for indie budgets\"\n- When to use: Targeting smaller studios who want big-studio capabilities\n\n**Recommended starting point:** Angle 2 (Churn Prevention System) for ROI-focused audiences, Angle 4 (Gaming-Native Analytics) for technical audiences frustrated with generic tools.\n\n---\n\n**To properly execute this skill, please provide:**\n1. The specific product/service/offer you need positioned\n2. Your target audience\n3. Any current messaging or competitive context\n\nI'll then run the complete angle-finding process and deliver 3-5 distinct positioning options with specific headline directions for each.",
