## Full Output

I notice that no specific inputs were provided for the brand-voice skill execution. To properly execute this skill, I need to gather the necessary information to determine which mode to use and collect the required data.

## Brand Voice Skill Execution

**STEP 1: Determine the Mode**

To execute the brand-voice skill properly, I need to ask the key qualifying question:

**Do you have existing content that represents how you want to sound?**

Please choose one option:

- **A) Yes, I have content I'm proud of** → Extract mode (analyze existing content)
- **B) No, I'm starting fresh** → Build mode (strategic construction)  
- **C) I have content but want to evolve** → Build mode (with existing reference)

---

## Required Inputs Based on Your Choice:

### If Option A (Extract Mode):
Please provide 3-5 pieces of your best content:
- Website copy (homepage, about page, key pages)
- Emails that felt authentic to you
- Social posts that performed well or felt natural
- Newsletter editions you're proud of
- Video/podcast transcripts
- Any content where you thought "this sounds exactly like me"

### If Option B or C (Build Mode):
I'll guide you through strategic questions covering:

**Identity Questions:**
- What 3-5 words describe your personality?
- What's your core belief about your industry/topic?
- What's your background that shapes your perspective?
- What makes you different from others in your space?

**Audience Questions:**
- Who specifically are you talking to?
- What tone resonates with them?
- What builds trust vs. what turns them off?

**Positioning Questions:**

- Where do you sit on accessible ↔ exclusive?
- Where do you sit on approachable ↔ authoritative?

**Practical Questions:**
- Any signature words/phrases?

- Stance on humor, profanity, hot takes?
