## Brand Voice Skill Execution

**First, I need to determine the mode:**

**Question:** Do you have existing content that represents how you want to sound?

Please choose one:
- **A) Yes, I have content I'm proud of** → I'll use Extract mode to analyze your existing content
- **B) No, I'm starting fresh** → I'll use Build mode to construct your voice strategically  
- **C) I have content but want to evolve** → I'll use Build mode with your existing content as reference

---

## Next Steps Based on Your Choice:

### If you chose A (Extract mode):
Please provide 3-5 pieces of content you consider "most you":
- Website copy (About page, homepage, key pages)
- Emails you've sent that felt authentic
- Social posts that performed well or felt natural
- Newsletter content
- Video/podcast transcripts
- Any content where you thought "this sounds like me"

### If you chose B or C (Build mode):
I'll ask you strategic questions about:
- Your personality and identity
- Your target audience
- Your positioning in the market
- Your aspirations and preferences
- Practical considerations

---

**To proceed with the brand-voice skill execution, please:**

1. **Tell me which mode (A, B, or C)**
2. **Provide the corresponding content or be ready to answer strategic questions**

Once I have this information, I'll execute the full skill process and deliver your complete voice profile in the specified format.

Which option resonates with you?
