Lister’s is co founded by Laura and her partner Tom, and Laura is a female founder who has played a huge role in building the business behind the scenes.  This is what personal brand actually looks like. Not aesthetics or logos, but the founder showing up as the face of trust, story, and process.  Founder led content builds credibility faster than polished ads. It works for organic, paid, and even wholesale growth.  If you are a founder, especially a female founder, this is your reminder that your story is one of your strongest commercial assets.",

      "text": "Women Don’t Need Empowering. They Need the Truth.   When veteran founder Nichola Quail says women need to “get out of their own way,” she is not asking for permission from the empowerment industry. She is calling it out. In this punchy conversation on The Chief Uncensored, host Paul Essery digs into why so few solo female founders are seizing the AI moment, even when the tools are cheap, accessible, and in everyone’s hands.   Quail has built a global market research business by backing overlooked challenger brands and pairing them with top-tier independent researchers who usually sit far out of reach of early-stage budgets. Her message to female entrepreneurs is simple and uncomfortable: the funding gap is real, the bias is real, but opting out of the game guarantees you lose.   Bottom line: Stop waiting to be empowered; pick a lane, learn your numbers, use AI as a tool—not a crutch—and step into the rooms where decisions get made.

It’s so easy to get stuck in your own bubble when you’re running a startup, so being in a room with talented founders across health, retail, media, parenting and tech was a great reset.  Huge thanks to Emmie Faust, Dan Bowyer  and the whole FFR team for putting together a genuinely useful agenda with brilliant speakers.  This came at an interesting moment for The Haud. Our MVP is live, we have exciting partnerships in the pipeline, and a new marketplace on the way that will let us move from scrappy to scalable. With the backing and guidance we’ve had through Durham University Venture Lab, it feels like we’ve stepping into a new chapter.   Very grateful for events like this that remind me why I started, and for communities that make the founder journey feel a little less lonely 🙌  #FemaleFoundersRise #FemaleFounders #Startups #TheHaud #Women",

Huge thanks to The Entrepreneurs Network and Barclays UK for championing female founders and backing this important work.  The findings are a wake-up call: on current trends, female academic entrepreneurs in the UK may not reach parity with their male counterparts in terms of commercialising research until 2060.  While there are challenges for all spinout founders, women often face distinct, disproportionate and compounding barriers — rooted in academic culture, risk aversion, and a lack of tailored support.

There’s no one to call and ask,  “Is this right?”  “Am I doing too much?”  “Is this how success is supposed to feel?”  You make decisions alone. You second-guess everything.   And the hardest part isn’t the work. It’s wondering whether staying true to your values will cost you growth.

So if you’re moving slowly, choosing integrity, and building with intention, you’re not behind.  You’re building something that will last.  And if you’re a female founder navigating this quietly, trying to grow without compromising who you are, this is the work I care about most.  I work with women who want their businesses to feel aligned, ethical, and beautifully theirs.  You don’t have to build alone.  🌸💌 Work with me: https://lnk",

In this episode of HER FUND Talks, I speak with Charlotte Caseris ☀️ - HR expert, founder of Hormê  – Innovation RH, and advisor at WILLA, France’s top incubator for female founders.  We explore: ▪️ Why women’s ideas are often heard differently ▪️ The “confidence paradox” and how it shapes fundraising outcomes ▪️ How coaching, clarity, and networks can redefine growth ▪️ And why we need to rethink what success and failure look like in innovation  Charlotte brings sharp insight from the intersection of people, purpose, and scale, and offers real strategies for building ventures that last. 🎧 Watch the full episode: https://lnkd.in/dFpYcjVr  #HERFundTalks #WomenEntrepreneurs #InclusiveFunding #StartupGrowth #Leadership #HRInnovation #FemaleFounders #ConfidenceGap  HER FUND Project, DIR.BG, Beyond Accelerator, The Edge, JA Europe",

It was great to reconnect with founders and colleagues from across the network and hear how journeys have evolved, what’s changed, what’s scaling, and where barriers still show up.  The report explores the landscape for female-led university spinouts, looking at who gets funded, who scales, and where structural gaps still exist between research, commercialisation and growth.  One stat from the report really stayed with me: 👉 Fewer than 8% of university spinouts have all-women founding teams, compared to 75% with all-male teams.  It’s a stark reminder of why visibility, access, and sustained support matter, not just at idea stage, but all the way through scale.  #FemaleFounders #WomenInInnovation #Spinouts #Entrepreneurship  Ali Chappell Trish McClay Danielle Jenkins Amy Morgan",

Responsible for my team, for the commitments we make to clients, and for building something that lasts.  I know so many women founders who carry this responsibility, often quietly, often alone.  What I’ve learned is that calm doesn’t come from working harder or “being tougher.” It comes from understanding what’s actually going on in your business.  Because when you can see the numbers, the noise drops.  If you’re a female founder reading this: you’re not behind, you’re not failing. And you’re definitely not alone. 🩵",

      "text": "Yesterday at the House of Lords, The Entrepreneurs Network and Barclays launched the latest Female Founders Forum report, Ideas to Impact, a deep dive into why women remain underrepresented in UK university spinouts.  A few findings from the report that really stood out: 🔹 Only 8% of UK university spinouts are founded by all-female teams, while 75% are all-male  🔹 This isn’t about confidence, ambition, or capability, it’s about how the system is designed and who it’s designed for  Huge credit to The Entrepreneurs Network, Barclays, and the Female Founders Forum for nearly a decade of evidence-led work that doesn’t just diagnose the problem, but pushes towards action. Special applause to Philip Salter, Victoria Collins MP, Juliet Gouldman, and   Jennifer Sieg for driving this forward.",

This week, we’re featuring Georgia Grace Edwards of Gnara, who turned a deeply personal, widely ignored problem into patented technology now worn by women all over the world.  Most outdoor gear wasn’t designed with women in mind.  Georgia Grace Edwards learned that the hard way while working as a glacier guide in Alaska — spending 8–12 hours a day on ice, stripping off layers in freezing temperatures just to use the bathroom, sometimes staying cold for hours afterward. At one point, she started dehydrating herself just to avoid it. What shocked her later wasn’t the experience itself.  It was learning how normal it was.  Through surveys of tens of thousands of women, Georgia discovered that more than half had experienced a bathroom accident outdoors — not from carelessness, but because the gear they wore was never designed",

But the same thing stood out — belief changing posture, voice, and clarity.  It reminded me of a classic experiment. Two average students. Same potential. One teacher believed in one of them — and that student thrived.  Not because he was smarter. But because he was believed in.  That’s what I saw in those founders. Confidence born from being seen and supported. Huge congratulations to Pia Haugseth from Norvern for winning Favourite Business Idea 🌟  And thank you to everyone who made this event happen — these moments create belief, and belief creates growth.

I have years of experience, data, and practical methods for building tech teams in a smart and efficient way. But a room full of female founders doesn’t necessarily need another framework.

And yet, the more time I spend with founders, investors, and operators, the more I feel the gap between support and power. The biggest fallacy is selling stories, not economics. The biggest reset we need is less optics, more transfer.  “Many iconic female founders fall into two camps: those who built companies before today’s complex digital economy, and those with deep privilege—family wealth, elite networks or both. Their stories inspire, but they aren’t replicable. And because events continually platform the same figures, they often dominate the narrative.”  “And when women founders do not talk about negative outcomes—losing money in the exit process or calling a deal a strategic partnership when it's an \"acquire-hire\" deal—the downside is nobody can really get lessons learned and do better.”   My latest Forbes article explores this further.  https://lnkd.in/ea5qY8kE",

I’ve noticed that some women will describe themselves as “not business people” or “clueless at business”.  What I’ve learned is that this framing isn’t neutral. Over time, it shapes who feels entitled to decide, to lead, and to take up space.  Research from King's College London  suggests women are more likely to underestimate their competence and over-emphasise gaps in their knowledge.  Meanwhile, many male founders learn in public while projecting certainty.  Neither approach guarantees success, but one gives you permission to act like a founder before you feel ready.  I don’t think confidence needs to be loud (although if you want to be loud, you should). But I do think it needs to exist.

Female Founders Raise at Google UK headquarters was a reminder that progress speeds up when experience, ambition and honesty share the same room. Investors didn’t speak in abstractions — they shared practical guidance. What actually matters. What gets remembered. What moves a decision forward.  Founders, in turn, shared lessons from the front line of raising — what worked, what didn’t, and what we would do differently next time.  What stood out most was more than inspiration, it was alignment.  When founders gather, clarity comes faster. You see the patterns faster, tune out the noise, and leave with clarity that turns into action.  Huge thanks to Emmie Faust and Female Founders Rise, Google for Startups and British Business Bank for bringing us all together.  Because when founders truly connect, progress compounds.",

On Wednesday I spent the day at Google with an incredible community of women at Female Founders Raise, bringing founders and investors together through Female Founders Rise (huge thanks to Emmie Faust and Dan Bowyer).  One of the standout moments?   Turning the tables...and having investors pitch to founders.  It was refreshing, slightly uncomfortable (for them!), and genuinely insightful.   My biggest takeaways:  1. Investors invest in people: if you don't have traction through numbers you need traction through founder passion  2. Investment partnerships are like a marriage: don't get into bed with anyone you don't want to wake up next to with a hangover   3. First Mover Advantage is a myth: better is always better than fast  Grateful for the honesty in the room and the reminder that fundraising is about alignment as much as it's about capital.",

They’re stuck because they’re asking this question on repeat:  “What should I actually be focusing on right now?” Growth? Profitability? Stability? Systems? Visibility? Team?  And the truth is, trying to do all of it at once is usually what slows everything down.  Here’s a simple reframe that helps cut through the noise 👇  🔍 Ask yourself ONE question:  What is the single constraint in my business right now? Not the loudest problem. Not the one Instagram is talking about. The actual bottleneck.  Examples: If sales are inconsistent → your focus is demand & positioning If revenue is strong but you’re exhausted → your focus is systems & delegation If you’re busy but not profitable → your focus is pricing & margins If growth feels chaotic → your focus is process before scale  🚫 What most founders do instead: Chase shiny opportunities Say yes to “strategic” partnerships too early Add offers instead of simplifying Confuse mo",

In this era of misinformation, teens globally need luna more than ever.

The facts are hard to ignore:  In the UK, women make up only around 16.9% of the engineering & technology workforce.   And in UK automotive, female representation is still under 20%.  So why does that gap still exist?  Unconscious bias in hiring - often unintentional, but it shows up in how job criteria are written, how “good fit” is judged, and who gets the benefit of the doubt.  Mirrored bias / imposter syndrome - many brilliant women will only apply when they meet every requirement, while most men apply when they only meet a few.

Huge thanks to The Entrepreneurs Network and Barclays UK for championing female founders and backing this important work.  The findings are a wake-up call: on current trends, female academic entrepreneurs in the UK may not reach parity with their male counterparts in terms of commercialising research until 2060.  While there are challenges for all spinout founders, women often face distinct, disproportionate and compounding barriers — rooted in academic culture, risk aversion, and a lack of tailored support.

A software engineer by background, Tammy founded Virsys12 to help payers and health plan enterprises manage provider network data by creating a single source of truth for provider credentialing and network management.  Over a fourteen year journey, Tammy grew Virsys12 into a trusted, industry leading platform. In October 2025, the company was acquired by HealthStream (Nasdaq HSTM), marking a significant milestone in her entrepreneurial story.  Tammy’s career is a powerful reminder of what is possible when technical expertise, vision, and perseverance come together, especially in industries where women remain underrepresented.  We are grateful for leaders like Tammy who continue to build with intention, lead with clarity, and inspire the next generation of innovators.",

      "text": "💬 “We often meet brilliant women with strong businesses - but they’re still playing small.”  This quote from Anna Vaughan of The Scottish National Investment Bank captures the heart of why the Women to Women (W2W) Programme exists: to help female founders raise their sights and secure the investment they truly need to grow.  We recently sat down with Anna, the Bank’s Director of Marketing and Communications and a passionate advocate for gender equity in business. In this conversation, she shares refreshingly honest insights on:  💡 What investors really want to see in a pitch 💡 Why women need to ask for more, and start earlier 💡 How the Bank is actively supporting founders long before they’re “investment ready” 💡 The surprising value of a strong board, and why it’s never too early to build one  From demystifying equity and debt to helping founders think beyond “getting by”, Anna’s takeaways are gold dust for any woman considering investment in her business.  Whether you’re just starting",

It's not ideas. It isn’t ability. It’s access.  🫡 Access to funding 🫡 Access to networks 🫡 Access to mentors 🫡 Access to rooms where decisions get made  And one of the most frustrating parts is how the funding conversation often plays out:  Women are more likely to be treated like a risk to manage. So we get asked questions like “How will you stop this failing?” While men get asked “How big can this get?”  It's the same ambition. Just a different lens.  So why does this matter Amber...?

While Africa's startup ecosystem celebrates a \"funding rebound,\" female-led ventures captured just 2% of capital in 2024 and it's getting WORSE (0.9% in early 2025).  Here's the frustration: ✅ Naked Insurance (female co-founder): $38M raise, Africa's largest insurtech deal ✅ Rivy (female founder): <1% NPL ratio, better than most banks ✅ Jem HR (female co-founder): Scaling WhatsApp-first HR to deskless workers ✅ FARO: Pan-African AI expansion plans  When women DO access capital, they're building exceptional companies. The data shows: 📉 28% of pre-seed deals have female co-founders 📉 By Series B/C? Just 5% 📉 Women raise 2.5x LESS on average  700+ rounds with female co-founders have closed since 2019.

So many women build in isolation thinking: “If I can just push harder, I’ll figure it out.”  What that actually looks like over time: – slower progress – second-guessing good instincts – missed opportunities you only see after – exhaustion that ambition can’t fix  Not because you’re incapable. But because no serious build happens in a vacuum.  Support isn’t hand-holding. It’s: 📍Proximity to people slightly ahead of you 📍Pattern recognition from shared experience 📍Honest feedback before mistakes get expensive  So here’s the real question 👇 Do founders actually move faster alone — or with the right support around them?
